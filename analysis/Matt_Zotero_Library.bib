For each item, an incorrect or don't know response was coded as 0 and correct response as 1. Exploratory factor analyses based on polychoric correlations showed two separate factors for all sites. Two-parameter item response theory (IRT) analysis (bifactorial multiple indicators multiple causes confirmatory factor analysis models) consistently showed a general first factor and a second `method' factor. One single global latent variable seemed to sufficiently well capture most of the systematic variation in knowledge. Some items did not discriminate well between levels of the underlying knowledge latent variable and information values were highest for low levels of knowledge. The scale might be improved by adding items, in particular items that are more difficult to answer. Some differential item functioning effects related to site and socioeconomic status were identified. Scores on the latent knowledge variable were particularly low among females in Dar es Salaam and Mankweng, and were negatively associated with socioeconomic status. This study illustrates advantages of using IRT analysis instead of more conventional approaches to examining psychometric properties of knowledge scales.},

The short version of the Dental Anxiety Inventory (S-DAI) contains nine items of the Dental Anxiety Inventory (DAI), which was designed to take into account three situations that may evoke dental anxiety, four time elements in which dental anxiety may be provoked, and three reactions. The aim was to assess the validity and reliability of the S-DAI in a sample of highly anxious dental patients applying for treatment at a dental fear clinic in the Netherlands. Three hundred and twenty-one patientslled out several questionnaires assessing dental anxiety (S-DAI, DAS, and a 10-point Likert-scale) and psychological complaints. Total mean score on the S-DAI for women (mean=40.5, s=5.7) was some-what higher than for men (mean=38.8, s=6.9) (t(306)=2.35; P=0.019). Cronbach's {$\alpha$} for the present sample was 0.88. Correlations with other measures of dental anxiety were 0.73 with the DAS (P {$<$} 0.001) and 0.69 (P {$<$} 0.001) with the 10-point scale. The results indicated that the S-DAI has good reliability and construct validity. It was concluded that the S-DAI is easy to administer in general dental practices and dental fear clinics and has satisfactory psychometric qualities.},

  abstract = {This paper examines attention checks and manipulation validations to detect inattentive respondents in primary empirical data collection. These prima facie attention checks range from the simple such as reverse scaling first proposed a century ago to more recent and involved methods such as evaluating response patterns and timed responses via online data capture tools. The attention check validations also range from easily implemented mechanisms such as automatic detection through directed queries to highly intensive investigation of responses by the researcher. The latter has the potential to introduce inadvertent researcher bias as the researcher's judgment may impact the interpretation of the data. The empirical findings of the present work reveal that construct and scale validations show consistently significant improvement in the fit statistics\textemdash a finding of great use for researchers working predominantly with scales and constructs for their empirical models. However, based on the rudimentary experimental models employed in the analysis, attention checks generally do not show a consistent, systematic improvement in the significance of test statistics for experimental manipulations. This latter result indicates that, by their very nature, attention checks may trigger an inherent trade-off between loss of sample subjects\textemdash lowered power and increased Type II error\textemdash and the potential of capitalizing on chance alone\textemdash the possibility that the previously significant results were in fact the result of Type I error. The analysis also shows that the attrition rates due to attention checks\textemdash upwards of 70\% in some observed samples\textemdash are far larger than typically assumed. Such loss rates raise the specter that studies not validating attention may inadvertently increase their Type I error rate. The manuscript provides general guidelines for various attention checks, discusses the psychological nuances of the methods, and highlights the delicate balance among incentive alignment, monetary compensation, and the subsequently triggered mood of respondents.},

Multiple mediator modelling provided evidence that coping styles partially mediated the relationship between perfectionism and depression. These findings advance current knowledge by suggesting how perfectionism may contribute to depression and may inform the development of more effective prevention and intervention programs for depression.},

  abstract = {This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine households' behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance the effectiveness of interventions.},

  abstract = {The world's climate is changing and will continue to change into the coming century at rates projected to be unprecedented in recent human history. The risks associated with these changes are real but highly uncertain. Societal vulnerability to the risks associated with climate change may exacerbate ongoing social and economic challenges, particularly for those parts of societies dependent on resources that are sensitive to changes in climate. Risks are apparent in agriculture, fisheries and many other components that constitute the livelihood of rural populations in developing countries. In this paper we explore the nature of risk and vulnerability in the context of climate change and review the evidence on present-day adaptation in developing countries and on coordinated international action on future adaptation. We argue that all societies are fundamentally adaptive and there are many situations in the past where societies have adapted to changes in climate and to similar risks. But some sectors are more sensitive and some groups in society more vulnerable to the risks posed by climate change than others. Yet all societies need to enhance their adaptive capacity to face both present and future climate change outside their experienced coping range. The challenges of climate change for development are in the present. Observed climate change, present-day climate variability and future expectations of change are changing the course of development strategies - development agencies and governments are now planning for this adaptation challenge. The primary challenge, therefore, posed at both the scale of local natural resource management and at the scale of international agreements and actions, is to promote adaptive capacity in the context of competing sustainable development objectives.},

Stronger perceptions of powerlessness and the commons dilemma were related to lower levels of action to mitigate climate change and lesser importance being placed upon climate change as an influence on individual actions. The perceived risk of climate change and the perception that humans influence climate change were the strongest predictors of mitigation action.},

  abstract = {In general, suicide frequencies peak in spring and early summer and depict a low in autumn and winter months. Suicide seasonality is a ubiquitous phenomenon; however, recent studies have indicated that it is related particularly to violent suicide methods. We investigated differences in suicide seasonalities by suicide methods using Swiss mortality data. The suicide data were extracted from the Swiss cause of death statistics and cover the period 1969-1994. In this period 37,518 suicides (ICD-8 codes 950-959) were registered in the mortality statistics. The data were analysed by the Edwards' method, which examines unimodal sinusoidal patterns in aggregated monthly data, and by spectral analysis with disaggregated monthly data. Overall, Swiss suicide data in 1969-1994 depict the expected pattern with a peak in May and June and a low in December. However, analyses by suicide methods show that there is no common pattern. Suicide seasonalities are absent or weak in some violent as well as non-violent methods (firearms, cutting, crashing, poisoning). Even if clearly present (hanging, drowning, jumping from high places, unspecified/other), the seasonalities show distinct patterns and cycles. Apart from sinusoidal patterns, there are also outliers: in overall data as well as in most method-specific data, the December frequencies fall more than 10\% below the neighbouring months. The decrease of the frequencies culminates at Christmas/New Year and then returns to average levels. Hence, the seasonality of the overall Swiss suicide frequencies is but a compound seasonality. It largely depends on specific suicide methods and different cyclical dynamics.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent research has corroborated the notion that seasonality in suicide is more heterogeneous and less consistent than postulated by former scholars. This work investigates the smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland between the late 19th and the end of the 20th century. It includes analyses by region and by suicide method.Methods: Monthly suicide frequencies in Switzerland are available for the period 1876\textendash 2000. Data on canton/region are available for the periods 1901\textendash 1920 and 1969\textendash 2000, and data on suicide method for the periods 1881\textendash 1920 and 1969\textendash 2000. Analyses focusing on the overall change rely on data aggregated by quinquennia. The Edwards' test and the peak-low ratio were used in univariate analyses of seasonality. Putative determinants of the peak-low ratio were examined using regression analysis with cantonal data.Results: The decrease of seasonal effects in suicide applies to a period of more than 100 years in Switzerland. Big differences of seasonal effects have existed all the time with regard to specific methods and to specific regions. No seasonality was apparent in poisoning, and in Geneva and Basle City, respectively. However, the seasonal effects have been most impressive in drowning and hanging suicides, and in rural Catholic regions. In regression analysis, the decline in suicide seasonality is associated with the decline in the agricultural work force.Conclusions: The smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland has been a continuous long term process, which probably started by the end of 19th century. Seasonal effects in suicide will probably fade away in most regions of Switzerland and in most suicide methods. This process is in parallel with the disappearance of the traditional rural society.},

The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the decrease in suicide rate at the end of the year is extended over the last weeks of the year and represents a specific type of seasonal effect. Suicide data were extracted from individual records of the Swiss mortality statistics, 1969-2003. The data were aggregated to daily frequencies of suicide across the year. Specifically, the period October-February was examined using time-series analysis, i.e., the Box-Jenkins approach with intervention models. The time series models require a step function to account for the gradual drop in suicide frequencies in December. The decrease in suicide frequencies includes the whole Advent and is accentuated at Christmas. After the New Year, there is a sharp recovery in men's suicide rate but not in women's. The reduction in the suicide rate during the last weeks of the year exceeds the well-recognised effect of reduced rates on major public holidays. It involves valuable challenges for suicide prevention such as timing of campaigns and enhancement of social networks.},

However, cross-correlations of data series based on moving frames showed a minor peak in associations for summer frames and a major peak in associations for winter frames, the latter reflecting suicides performed mainly outdoors (being run over by a train and jumping from high places). The results represent a novel minor effect in seasonality of suicide, which is hardly compatible with the hypothesized role of temperature in suicide seasonality.},

In particular, the focus is on studies dealing with the historical change of seasonality, cross-sectional comparisons including method-specific diversity, and the association with weather variables and other putative covariates. Recent research has shown that in Western countries the seasonality of suicide is tending to diminish and may, eventually, disappear. It can no longer be considered a universal and homogeneous phenomenon. In addition, different major seasonal cycles have now been determined which mainly depend on different suicide methods. Just as in the epidemiology of suicide methods, the (seasonal) availability and perceived adequacy of methods emerge as the major driving force beyond the seasonal phenomena in suicide.},

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

The strength of expert judgement is denned, and estimated using the official forecasts of cause-specific mortality in the United States.

However, relatively little is known about the relationship of subjective SES to CVD risk, particularly within different racial groups. Subjective SES and Framingham 10-year CVD risk profile were examined in 1,722 socioeconomically diverse Black and White adults enrolled in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. The sample had a mean age of 47.7 years, was 57\% female, 56\% African American, and 39\% living in poverty. Subjective SES was associated with greater CVD risk after adjustment for poverty status, substance use, BMI, depression, antihypertensives, and co-morbidities (B = -.059, t[1,1711] = -2.44, P = .015). However, when the analysis was race-stratified, subjective SES was associated with CVD risk in Whites (B = -.074, F[1,787] = -2.01, P = .045), but not Blacks. These results suggest that subjective SES may aid in predicting CVD risk in Whites, but not Blacks. It is important to note that these analyses were adjusted for poverty status, a potent indicator of objective SES. Thus, these findings further suggest that for Whites, subjective SES may influence CVD risk beyond that associated with objective SES. These findings highlight the potential importance of patients' subjective SES in CVD risk detection.},

There were five instruction conditions: "just take," "fake good," "coach overt," "coach covert," and "coach both." All subjects completed both overt and covert tests and a measure of intelligence. Results provided strong evidence for the coachability of the overt integrity test, over and above the much smaller elevation in the faking condition. The covert test apparently could be neither coached nor faked successfully. Scores on both integrity tests tended to be positively correlated with intelligence in the coaching and faking conditions.

Many previous studies have found a negative association between health-protective behaviours and belief in the specific form of misinformation popularly known as `conspiracy theory'. Concerns have arisen regarding the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories on social media.MethodsThree questionnaire surveys of social media use, conspiracy beliefs and health-protective behaviours with regard to COVID-19 among UK residents were carried out online, one using a self-selecting sample (N = 949) and two using stratified random samples from a recruited panel (N = 2250, N = 2254).ResultsAll three studies found a negative relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 health-protective behaviours, and a positive relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and use of social media as a source of information about COVID-19. Studies 2 and 3 also found a negative relationship between COVID-19 health-protective behaviours and use of social media as a source of information, and Study 3 found a positive relationship between health-protective behaviours and use of broadcast media as a source of information.ConclusionsWhen used as an information source, unregulated social media may present a health risk that is partly but not wholly reducible to their role as disseminators of health-related conspiracy beliefs.},

  abstract = {Objective Frontline health professionals need a ``red flag'' tool to aid their decision making about whether to make a referral for a full diagnostic assessment for an autism spectrum condition (ASC) in children and adults. The aim was to identify 10 items on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (Adult, Adolescent, and Child versions) and on the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) with good test accuracy. Method: A case sample of more than 1,000 individuals with ASC (449 adults, 162 adolescents, 432 children and 126 toddlers) and a control sample of 3,000 controls (838 adults, 475 adolescents, 940 children, and 754 toddlers) with no ASC diagnosis participated. Case participants were recruited from the Autism Research Centre's database of volunteers. The control samples were recruited through a variety of sources. Participants completed full-length versions of the measures. The 10 best items were selected on each instrument to produce short versions. Results: At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 adult, sensitivity was 0.88, specificity was 0.91, and positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.85. At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 adolescent, sensitivity was 0.93, specificity was 0.95, and PPV was 0.86. At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 child, sensitivity was 0.95, specificity was 0.97, and PPV was 0.94. At a cut-point of 3 on the Q-CHAT-10, sensitivity was 0.91, specificity was 0.89, and PPV was 0.58. Internal consistency was {$>$}0.85 on all measures. Conclusions: The short measures have potential to aid referral decision making for specialist assessment and should be further evaluated.},

  abstract = {Background. In previous studies of the seasonality of suicide, peaks have often been found in the number of suicides in the spring and early summer in both northern and southern hemispheres. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the distribution of suicide as to month, seasons, day of the week, and time of the day. Method. Data on suicides in Cagliari (Italy) in the period 1990-1994 were analyzed by means of spectral analysis, cosinor and multiple regression analysis. Results. Two seasonal rhythms, i.e. an annual and a semiannual rhythm, accounted for 25\% of the variation in the total number of suicides. The peak number of suicides occurred in February with a second less significant peak in June and July. Lows were found in November and December. There were no significant differences in number of suicides in relation to days of the week. Three rhythms, i.e. 24 hours (circadian), 8 hours and 1 hour, explained 63.9\% of the variance in the number of suicides by time of the day. Peak numbers in number of suicides were found between 08:31 and 12:30h, while the number of suicides was also significantly higher between 12:31h and 20:30h than between 20.31h and 8.30h. Age and gender did not significantly affect the seasonal and circadian rhythms in suicide. Conclusions. The results show that there is a significantly seasonal variation and a highly significant variation by time of the day in suicide in Cagliari, Italy.},

Theoretical distributions are described by quantities called parameters, notably the mean and standard deviation.1 Methods that use distributional assumptions are called parametric methods, because we estimate the parameters of the distribution assumed for the data. Frequently used parametric methods include t tests and analysis of variance for comparing groups, and least squares regression and correlation for studying the relation between variables.

Choking, injections and drilling were the most common fears. Internal consistency indicated a high level of reliability. Factor analysis (principal components, varimax rotation) found three factors accounting for 54\% of the scale variance. Factors were defined as (1) fear of highly invasive procedures, such as injections and drilling; (2) fear of potential victimization, including fear of strangers, choking and hospitals; and (3) fear of less invasive procedures, such as opening the mouth and being examined by the dentist. The factor pattern was similar to results obtained with a sample of children in the United States. There were significant differences in fear score for children whose parents reported them fearful and/or reported them to have had a previous bad experience at the dentist. Boys (but not girls) who had a DMFT score of at least 1 had a significantly higher mean DFSS-C score (21\dbend 1) than those who were caries free (20\dbend 0). These data suggest the DFSS-C operates in Finland as it does in the United States, but that culture-specific minimal scores for determining high dental fear are needed. go.},

These results have been replicated in several contexts by several research teams. The standard explanation of this weapons effect on aggressive behavior involves priming; identification of a weapon is believed to automatically increase the accessibility of aggression-related thoughts. Two experiments using a word pronunciation task tested this hypothesis. Both experiments consisted of multiple trials in which a prime stimulus (weapon or nonweapon) was followed by a target word (aggressive or nonaggressive) that was to be read as quickly as possible. The prime stimuli were words in Experiment 1 and pictures in Experiment 2. Both experiments showed that the mere identification of a weapon primes aggression-related thoughts. A process model linking weapons as primes to aggressive behavior is discussed briefly.},

If experts are correct in their predictions of global warming, the authors contend that aggression will increase for two reasons: (1) increased temperature has a direct impact on increased aggression; and (2) increased temperature has an indirect impact on societal factors that are related to increased aggression, like displacement, poverty, and physically uncomfortable living conditions. The authors rely on Anderson's General Aggression Model to derive these predictions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (book)},

Our analysis of the extent of dissonance between these widely espoused ideals and scientists' perceptions of their own and others' behavior is based on survey responses from 3,247 mid- and early-career scientists who had research funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. We found substantial normative dissonance, particularly between espoused ideals and respondents' perceptions of other scientists' typical behavior. Also, respondents on average saw other scientists' behavior as more counternormative than normative. Scientists' views of their fields as cooperative or competitive were associated with their normative perspectives, with competitive fields showing more counternormative behavior. The high levels of normative dissonance documented here represent a persistent source of stress in science.},

Vaccines are considered indispensable against bioterrorism. They can combat resistance to antibiotics in some pathogens. Noncommunicable diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease, could also be reduced by influenza vaccination. Immunization programmes have improved the primary care infrastructure in developing countries, lowered mortality in childhood and empowered women to better plan their families, with consequent health, social and economic benefits. Vaccination helps economic growth everywhere, because of lower morbidity and mortality. The annual return on investment in vaccination has been calculated to be between 12\% and 18\%. Vaccination leads to increased life expectancy. Long healthy lives are now recognized as a prerequisite for wealth, and wealth promotes health. Vaccines are thus efficient tools to reduce disparities in wealth and inequities in health.},

Method: The large DEPRES Study dataset covering representative population samples of six European countries (wave I: 38,434 men and 40,024 women; wave II: 563 men and 1321 women treated for depression) was analyzed for gender differences. Results: In wave I marked gender differences were found in the six-month prevalence rate for major depression but less so for minor depression; the gender differences for major depression persisted across all age groups. Even after stratification by clinically significant impairment and paid employment status, men reported fewer symptoms than women; as a consequence, men reached the diagnostic threshold less often. In wave II there were clear gender differences in causal attribution and in coping. Men coped by increasing their sports activity and consumption of alcohol and women through emotional release and religion. Women felt the effects of depression in their quality of sleep and general health, whereas men felt it more in their ability to work. Limitations: The second wave of the study comprises treated depressives only and may be less representative than the first wave.},

The dominant paradigm in climate science, of an ensemble sampled from a distribution centred on the truth, is contrasted with the paradigm of a statistically indistinguishable ensemble, which has been more commonly adopted in other fields. This latter interpretation (which gives rise to a natural probabilistic interpretation of ensemble output) leads to new insights about the evaluation of ensemble performance. Using the well-known rank histogram method of analysis, we find that the CMIP3 ensemble generally provides a rather good sample under the statistically indistinguishable paradigm, although it appears marginally over-dispersive and exhibits some modest biases. These results contrast strongly with the incompatibility of the ensemble with the truth-centred paradigm. Thus, our analysis provides for the first time a sound theoretical foundation, with empirical support, for the probabilistic use of multi-model ensembles in climate research.},

PTSD was best represented by a 2nd-order PTSD factor that manifests in 3 symptom clusters (Intrusion/Active Avoidance, Numbing/Passive Avoidance, and Arousal). This model was cross-validated on 3 age groups (late childhood, early adolescence, and late adolescence), and results indicated factorial invariance across groups. PTSD symptoms varied in relative centrality to the underlying dimensions of PTSD, which differed in their relations with anxiety and degree of traumatic exposure.

  abstract = {If you think that global warming means slightly hotter weather and a modest rise in sea levels that will persist only so long as fossil fuels hold out (or until we decide to stop burning them), think again. In The Long Thaw, David Archer, one of the world's leading climatologists, predicts that if we continue to emit carbon dioxide we may eventually cancel the next ice age and raise the oceans by 50 meters. The great ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland may take more than a century to melt, and the overall change in sea level will be one hundred times what is forecast for 2100. By comparing the global warming projection for the next century to natural climate changes of the distant past, and then looking into the future far beyond the usual scientific and political horizon of the year 2100, Archer reveals the hard truths of the long-term climate forecast. Archer shows how just a few centuries of fossil-fuel use will cause not only a climate storm that will last a few hundred years, but dramatic climate changes that will last thousands. Carbon dioxide emitted today will be a problem for millennia. For the first time, humans have become major players in shaping the long-term climate. In fact, a planetwide thaw driven by humans has already begun. But despite the seriousness of the situation, Archer argues that it is still not too late to avert dangerous climate change--if humans can find a way to cooperate as never before. Revealing why carbon dioxide may be an even worse gamble in the long run than in the short, this compelling and critically important book brings the best long-term climate science to a general audience for the first time.},

  abstract = {Human cognitive abilities inter-correlate to form a positive matrix, from which a large first factor, called [`]Spearman's g' or general intelligence, can be extracted. General intelligence itself is correlated with many important health outcomes including cardio-vascular function and longevity. However, the important evolutionary question of whether intelligence is a fitness-related trait has not been tested directly, let alone answered. If the correlations among cognitive abilities are part of a larger matrix of positive associations among fitness-related traits, then intelligence ought to correlate with seemingly unrelated traits that affect fitness--such as semen quality. We found significant positive correlations between intelligence and 3 key indices of semen quality: log sperm concentration (r~=~.15, p~=~.002), log sperm count (r~=~.19, p~{$<~$}.001), and sperm motility (r~=~.14, p~=~.002) in a large sample of US Army Veterans. None was mediated by age, body mass index, days of sexual abstinence, service in Vietnam, or use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or hard drugs. These results suggest that a phenotype-wide fitness factor may contribute to the association between intelligence and health. Clarifying whether a fitness factor exists is important theoretically for understanding the genomic architecture of fitness-related traits, and practically for understanding patterns of human physical and psychological health.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed models (LMM) are frequently used to analyze repeated measures data, because they are more flexible to modelling the correlation within-subject, often present in this type of data. The most popular LMM for continuous responses assumes that both the random effects and the within-subjects errors are normally distributed, which can be an unrealistic assumption, obscuring important features of the variations present within and among the units (or groups). This work presents skew-normal liner mixed models (SNLMM) that relax the normality assumption by using a multivariate skew-normal distribution, which includes the normal ones as a special case and provides robust estimation in mixed models. The MCMC scheme is derived and the results of a simulation study are provided demonstrating that standard information criteria may be used to detect departures from normality. The procedures are illustrated using a real data set from a cholesterol study.},

Four characteristics of the general linear model are delineated and explained using a program for the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). This program can be duplicated by statistics students and used to teach the concept of the general linear model. More importantly, the characteristics of the general linear model can be used to teach students about the interrelationships between all parametric statistics. Students taught this way can integrate the information about the specific models into the framework of the general model. In this manner, the  learning of statistics becomes less of a chore of memorizing confusion and more of an adventure in learning and thinking. An appendix presents a program for the SPSS.

The aim of this study is to test the dissociation between wanting and liking in humans across two commonly used licit substances, alcohol and caffeine. The STRAP-R (Sensitivity To Reinforcement of Addictive and other Primary Rewards) questionnaire was administered to 285 alcohol users (mean age=33.30, SD= 8.83) and 134 coffee users (mean age=33.05, SD=8.10) ranging in their levels of substance use to assess wanting and liking. Findings showed that in high risk alcohol users wanting may drive alcohol consumption more so than liking, compared with low risk alcohol users. However, wanting and liking did not significantly dissociate as alcohol consumption increased. These findings partially support IST. Additionally, IST was not supported in coffee users. It is possible that caffeine functions differently at the neurological level compared with alcohol, perhaps explaining the lack of dissociation emerging in coffee users as caffeine use increased. Nevertheless, the current study makes several contributions to IST research. Future studies should focus on utilising the STRAP-R with a clinically dependent sample to test the dissociation between wanting and liking.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of pedestrian volume are important for analyzing pedestrian movement and safety; methods to estimate these volumes are continuously evolving and being improved. However, relatively little is known about the impact of weather conditions on pedestrian activity. This paper evaluates the effect of weather by including temperature, cloud cover, wind, and precipitation variables in a linear regression model of pedestrian volumes. Pedestrian volumes were collected over approximately one year using automated counters at 13 different locations in Alameda County, California. These volumes were compared with weather data available from nearby weather stations. Results show that several weather variables had a significant influence on pedestrian volumes during certain time periods. Rain had the largest effect on pedestrian volumes at a given location, though clouds, wind, and both hot and cold temperatures were also shown to decrease volumes. This study demonstrates the importance of accounting for weather when analyzing pedestrian volumes. Future research should attempt to understand how the effect of weather conditions on pedestrian volumes varies by geographic region, time period, and local land use and site characteristics.},

This study is unique in that a large amount of data in a single location was collected in a locale with an extreme range of weather conditions. Results indicate consistent patterns in relative volumes by hour of the day and month of the year that show that good adjustment factors can be developed to use with time-limited counts to estimate usage and pedestrian exposure to accidents. Predictive relationships were found between weather variables, season, and pedestrian volumes (30\% of the variation is accounted for). Consistent hourly patterns within a day and the consistency of day type (weekday or Saturday versus holiday or Sunday) suggest that correction factors and forecasting methods are feasible for pedestrian traffic volumes. The results indicate that weather such as cold temperatures or precipitation consistently reduces aggregate levels of walking by only a moderate amount (less than 20\%). Precipitation and season are found to affect pedestrian levels even when time of day and day of week are controlled, but other, larger, unmeasured factors are at play.},

This paper offers a Bourdieusian field analysis of major Australian newspaper coverage of the coal industry in relation to economic, political and environmental issues. Theoretically, it extends Bourdieu's field model to embrace the issue of visibility and invisibility of agents and their positions in the field, using the work of Goffman, Giddens and Ericson. Empirically it finds that both journalists and their sources actively engage with factors of invisibility and visibility in contesting the representation of coal industry interests in media coverage. Overall there is a common journalistic endorsement and visibility across all newspapers of the national and regional economic benefits of the coal mining and power generation industries, but marked differences among individual newspapers in how they position themselves and their sources with respect to climate change impacts and issues. A key factor in the contestation over the journalistic coverage is the production of visibility and invisibility for specific information and activity.},

Scales designed to measure each skill were developed and evaluated. Results showed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability and a clear factor structure. Most expected relationships with other constructs were significant. Findings suggest that mindfulness skills are differentially related to aspects of personality and mental health, including neuroticism, psychological symptoms, emotional intelligence, alexithymia, experiential avoidance, dissociation, and absorption.},

Minimum standards of human decency require that when people breach this important proscription by breaking the criminal law, the least that is expected of them is that they show some contrition. It follows that offenders who are remorseful should not be treated more leniently. The purpose of this article is to debunk the widely held intuitive view that remorseful offenders should be dealt with less harshly than other offenders. We argue that irrespective of which of the main theories of punishment one adopts, remorse is irrelevant to sentencing, and that it should henceforth be disregarded as a sentencing consideration. Even in the context of restorative theories of justice, remorse only has a marginal role.},

Articles were examined for each of 10 criteria for proper use and reporting of LR models. Substantial shortcomings were found in both use of LR and reporting of results. For many studies, the ratio of the number of outcome events to predictor variables (events per variable) was sufficiently small to call into question the accuracy of the regression model. Additionally, no studies reported validation analysis, regression diagnostics, or goodness-of-fit measures. It is recommended that authors, reviewers, and editors pay greater attention to guidelines concerning the use and reporting of LR models.},

Reporting of effect size in the psychological literature is patchy \textendash{} though this may be changing \textendash{} and when reported it is far from clear that appropriate effect size statistics are employed. This paper considers the practice of reporting point estimates of standardized effect size and explores factors such as reliability, range restriction and differences in design that distort standardized effect size unless suitable corrections are employed. For most purposes simple (unstandardized) effect size is more robust and versatile than standardized effect size. Guidelines for deciding what effect size metric to use and how to report it are outlined. Foremost among these are: (i) a preference for simple effect size over standardized effect size, and (ii) the use of confidence intervals to indicate a plausible range of values the effect might take. Deciding on the appropriate effect size statistic to report always requires careful thought and should be influenced by the goals of the researcher, the context of the research and the potential needs of readers.},

  abstract = {Introduction Dynamic relationships between the symptoms of psychosis can be shown in individual networks of psychopathology. In a single patient, data collected with the Experience Sampling Method (ESM\textendash a method to construct intensive time series of experience and context) can be used to study lagged associations between symptoms in relation to illness severity and pharmacological treatment.   Method The patient completed, over the course of 1 year, for 4 days per week, 10 daily assessments scheduled randomly between 10 minutes and 3 hours apart. Five a priori selected symptoms were analysed: `hearing voices', `down', `relaxed', `paranoia' and `loss of control'. Regression analysis was performed including current level of one symptom as the dependent variable and all symptoms at the previous assessment (lag) as the independent variables. Resulting regression coefficients were printed in graphs representing a network of symptoms. Network graphs were generated for different levels of severity: stable, impending relapse and full relapse.   Results ESM data showed that symptoms varied intensely from moment to moment. Network representations showed meaningful relations between symptoms, e.g. `down' and `paranoia' fuelling each other, and `paranoia' negatively impacting `relaxed'. During relapse, symptom levels as well as the level of clustering between symptoms markedly increased, indicating qualitative changes in the network. While `hearing voices' was the most prominent symptom subjectively, the data suggested that a strategic focus on `paranoia', as the most central symptom, had the potential to bring about changes affecting the whole network.   Conclusion Construction of intensive ESM time series in a single patient is feasible and informative, particularly if represented as a network, showing both quantitative and qualitative changes as a function of relapse.},

In this context, the logic of the proposition that past behavior is the best predictor of later behavior was also examined. The intervention was found to influence attitudes toward bus use, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control and, consistent with the theory, to affect intentions and behavior in the desired direction. Furthermore, the theory afforded accurate prediction of intention and behavior both before and after the intervention. In contrast, a measure of past behavior improved prediction of travel mode prior to the intervention, but lost its predictive utility for behavior following the intervention. In a test of the proposition that the effect of past on later behavior is due to habit formation, an independent measure of habit failed to mediate the effects of past on later behavior. It is concluded that choice of travel mode is largely a reasoned decision; that this decision can be affected by interventions that produce change in attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control; and that past travel choice contributes to the prediction of later behavior only if circumstances remain relatively stable.},

  abstract = {Aims To examine the effects of high ambient temperature (`heat stressor') on parasympathetically mediated cardiovascular reflexes (power of respiratory sinus dysrhythmia; change in heart rate elicited by change in posture from lying to standing [`30 : 15 ratio']). Methods Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in four weekly sessions, each of which was associated with one treatment condition (placebo at an ambient temperature of 22 \textdegree C; propranolol 40 mg at 22 \textdegree C; placebo at 40 \textdegree C; propranolol 40 mg at 40 \textdegree C), according to a balanced double-blind design. Heart rate was recorded by ECG, finger tremor (7\textendash 12 Hz) with an accelerometer strapped to the middle finger of the nondominant hand, and sublingual temperature by a mercury thermometer. Power of finger tremor and the variations of the R-R intervals of the ECG were obtained from Fourier transformations of the data. Data were analysed by analysis of variance, with repeated measures using a significance criterion of P {$<$} 0.05; individual comparisons of active treatment with placebo and of data obtained at 40 \textdegree C with those obtained at 22 \textdegree C were made with Fisher's Least Significant Difference test. Results Heart rate was increased by the heat stressor, and this increase was abolished by propranolol. The heat stressor reduced the power of respiratory sinus dysrhythmia and the 30 : 15 ratio, and increased the power of physiological finger tremor. Propranolol did not affect heat stressor-induced changes in the parasympathetic cardiac reflexes, but reduced the heat stressor-induced enhancement of finger tremor. Conclusions The increase in the power of physiological finger tremor at high ambient temperature is consistent with sympathetic activation, whereas the reduction in the power of respiratory sinus dysrhythmia and 30 : 15 ratio indicates a decrease in parasympathetic activity. These results demonstrate that high ambient temperature may induce vagal withdrawal in the heart.},

Behavioristic characterizations of cognitive properties are criticized in favor of an organizational approach focused on the internal dynamic relationships that constitute cognitive systems. A definition of cognition as adaptive-autonomy in the embodied and situated neurodynamic domain is provided: the compensatory regulation of a web of stability dependencies between sensorimotor structures is created and pre served during a historical/developmental process. We highlight the functional role of emotional embodiment: internal bioregulatory processes coupled to the formation and adaptive regulation of neurodynamic autonomy. Finally, we discuss a "minimally cognitive behavior program" in evolutionary simulation modeling suggesting that much is to be learned from a complementary "minimally cognitive organization program"},

It is suggested that models of complex conceptual structures (), language use in real-life conversational settings (), and speech production () might hold the key for solving these two important `second-generation' research problems.},

This inference is based on a t distribution and is derived from a Bayesian paradigm under the assumption that the complete-data degrees of freedom, {$\nu$}com, are infinite, but the number of imputations, m, is finite. When {$\nu$}com is small and there is only a modest proportion of missing data, the calculated repeated-imputation degrees of freedom, {$\nu$}m, for the t reference distribution can be much larger than {$\nu$}com, which is clearly inappropriate. Following the Bayesian paradigm, we derive an adjusted degrees of freedom, {$\nu\tilde$}m, with the following three properties: for fixed m and estimated fraction of missing information, {$\nu\tilde$}m monotonically increases in {$\nu$}com; {$\nu\tilde$}m is always less than or equal to {$\nu$}com; and {$\nu\tilde$}m equals {$\nu$}m when {$\nu$}com is infinite. A small simulation study demonstrates the superior frequentist performance when using {$\nu\tilde$}m rather than {$\nu$}m.},

This paper integrates three disparate but well-founded bodies of research - on the vulnerability of local places and social groups to climate change, on livelihoods and violent conflict, and the role of the state in development and peacemaking, to offer new insights into the relationships between climate change, human security, and violent conflict. It explains that climate change increasingly undermines human security in the present day, and will increasingly do so in the future, by reducing access to, and the quality of, natural resources that are important to sustain livelihoods. Climate change is also likely to undermine the capacity of states to provide the opportunities and services that help people to sustain their livelihoods. We argue that in certain circumstances these direct and indirect impacts of climate change on human security may in turn increase the risk of violent conflict. The paper then outlines the broad contours of a research programme to guide empirical investigations into the risks climate change poses to human security and peace.},

A recent model of psychological sex differences suggests that this is a major dimension in which the sexes differ, with males being more drawn to systemize than females. Currently, there are no self\textendash report measures to assess this important dimension. A second major dimension of sex differences is empathizing (the drive to identify mental states and respond to these with an appropriate emotion). Previous studies find females score higher on empathy measures. We report a new self\textendash report questionnaire, the Systemizing Quotient (SQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. It contains 40 systemizing items and 20 control items. On each systemizing item, a person can score 2, 1 or 0, so the SQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1, we measured the SQ of n = 278 adults (114 males, 164 females) from a general population, to test for predicted sex differences (male superiority) in systemizing. All subjects were also given the Empathy Quotient (EQ) to test if previous reports of female superiority would be replicated. In Study 2 we employed the SQ and the EQ with n = 47 adults (33 males, 14 females) with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high\textendash functioning autism (HFA), who are predicted to be either normal or superior at systemizing, but impaired at empathizing. Their scores were compared with n = 47 matched adults from the general population in Study 1. In Study 1, as predicted, normal adult males scored significantly higher than females on the SQ and significantly lower on the EQ. In Study 2, again as predicted, adults with AS/HFA scored significantly higher on the SQ than matched controls, and significantly lower on the EQ than matched controls. The SQ reveals both a sex difference in systemizing in the general population and an unusually strong drive to systemize in AS/HFA. These results are discussed in relation to two linked theories: the `empathizing\textendash systemizing' (E\textendash S) theory of sex differences and the extreme male brain (EMB) theory of autism.},

In Exp I, with 35 undergraduates, Ss received either a positive or negative evaluation from a confederate and were then provided with an opportunity to aggress against this person by means of electric shock. On the basis of previous research, it was predicted that high ambient temperatures (92-95 Deg.F) would facilitate aggression by those receiving positive evaluations but actually inhibit such behavior by those receiving negative assessments. Results confirm both predictions and also indicate that more moderate but still uncomfortably warm temperatures (82-85 Deg.F) produced similar effects. Exp II, with 64 male undergraduates, employed procedures similar to Exp I and examined the suggestion that administration of a cooling drink would reduce the impact of high ambient temperatures upon overt aggression. This prediction, too, was confirmed. The possible mediating role of negative affect with respect to the influence of ambient temperature and other environmental factors upon aggression is discussed.

On the basis of A. Bandura's (1973) social learning theory of aggression, it was predicted that uncomfortably hot environmental conditions would be most effective in facilitating later aggression when Ss had both witnessed the actions of the model and been exposed to strong provocation from the victim, but least effective in this regard when they had neither witnessed the actions of the model nor been exposed to prior instigation. In contrast to these predictions, results indicate that high ambient temperatures facilitated aggression by nonangered Ss but actually inhibited such behavior by those who had previously been provoked.

These possible distortions, or biases, include: a focus on harms that we cause, as opposed to those that we can remedy more easily; a feeling that those who cause a problem should fix it; a desire to undo a problem rather than compensate for its presence; parochial concern with one's own group (nation); and neglect of risks that are not available. Although most of these biases tend to make us attend relatively too much to global warming, other biases, such as wishful thinking, cause us to attend too little. I discuss these possible effects and illustrate some of them with an experiment conducted on the World Wide Web.},

Proponents of two kinds of approaches to model fit can be identified: those who adhere strictly to the result from a null hypothesis significance test, and those who ignore this and instead index model fit as an approximation function. Both have principled reasons for their respective course of action. This paper argues that the chi-square exact-fit test is the only substantive test of fit for SEM, but, its sensitivity to discrepancies from expected values at increasing sample sizes can be highly problematic if those discrepancies are considered trivial from an explanatory-theory perspective. On the other hand, suitably scaled indices of approximate fit do not possess this sensitivity to sample size, but neither are they "tests" of model fit. The proposed solution to this dilemma is to consider the substantive "consequences" of accepting one explanatory model over another in terms of the predictive accuracy of theory-relevant-criteria. If there are none to be evaluated, then it is proposed that no scientifically worthwhile distinction between "competing" models can thus be made, which of course begs the question as to why such a SEM application was undertaken in the first place.},

This review evaluates the factors contributing to lack of reproducibility, implications for environmental epidemiology, and strategies for mitigation.Recent FindingsAlthough publication bias and other types of selective reporting may contribute substantially to irreproducible results, underpowered analyses and low prevalence of true associations likely explain most failures to replicate novel scientific results. Epidemiologists can counter these risks by ensuring that analyses are well-powered or precise, focusing on scientifically justified hypotheses, strictly controlling type I error rates, emphasizing estimation over statistical significance, avoiding practices that introduce bias, or employing bias analysis and triangulation. Avoidance of p values has no effect on reproducibility if confidence intervals excluding the null are emphasized in a similar manner.SummaryIncreased attention to exposure mixtures and susceptible subpopulations, and wider use of omics technologies, will likely decrease the proportion of investigated associations that are true associations, requiring greater caution in study design, analysis, and interpretation. Though well intentioned, these recent trends in environmental epidemiology will likely decrease reproducibility if no effective actions are taken to mitigate the risk of spurious findings.},

The fact that the standard model is strictly applicable only when the manifest variables are scaled is a serious limitation in social science where the variables are often categorical. In this paper we aim to provide a theoretical framework within which methods for the factor analysis of categorical data can be devised and compared. Discussion is restricted to the case of ordered categories where the latent variables are continuous. It is argued that the choice of model should be made from a restricted set which includes two existing models as special cases. A new method is proposed together with a simple approximate technique of fitting for the one-factor model. The paper concludes with an evaluation of existing methods and makes some suggestions about the direction which future research should take.},

The average response rate was 55.6 with a standard deviation of 19.7. Variations among the journals such as the year of publication and other variables were discussed. Most notable is the decline through the years (average 48.4, standard deviation of 20.1, in 1995), the lower level found in studies involving top management or organizational representatives (average 36.1, standard deviation of 13.3), and the predominance of North American studies. It is suggested that the average and standard deviation found in this study should be used as a norm for future studies, bearing in mind the specific reference group.

Research has suggested that one of the main aspects that might contribute to this is the fact that RET are represented as industrial and urban, and thus, as having a different essence from rural landscapes, where they are usually deployed and which are represented as natural and unspoilt. However, this `hypothesis' of landscape essentialisation shaping people's responses to RET has not been explicitly examined. By drawing upon research from Social Psychology and Human Geography on essentialisation, we will examine if and how landscape (de-)essentialisation plays a role in people's responses to RET. Namely, by examining it as a rhetorical construction that can be strategically used to negotiate and legitimize given relations with place and associated responses to RET. Focus groups were conducted in the UK and Norway with members of local communities to be affected by the construction of HVPLs that will connect to new low carbon energy technologies. Analyses show that participants present British and Norwegian rural landscapes in general and HVPL as having two different essences, which justifies opposition to those infrastructures. However, analyses also show that essentialisation of the countryside is strategically used. Namely, participants also present the countryside in the place where they live as having more of the essence of the British or Norwegian countryside than other areas of the UK and Norway. In turn, this allows them to legitimize claims that whereas HVPL are `out of place' in the countryside in general, they are more so in the place where they live. The implications of these results for the definition of acceptable locations for RET and for research on people\textendash place relations and responses to place change, are discussed.},

For example, when offered a choice of a constant feeding option that always offers three seeds, and a risky option that offers either no seeds or six seeds with equal probability, most animals tested will be either risk-averse or risk-prone, preferring either the fixed or variable option respectively. Whether animals are risk-averse or risk-prone appears to depend on a range of factors, including the energetic status of the forager, the type of variance associated with the feeding options and even the number of feeding options between which the animal is choosing. These behavioural phenomena have attracted much theoretical interest, and a range of different explanations have been suggested, some based on a consideration of the psychological mechanisms involved in decision making, and others on a consideration of the Darwinian fitness consequences of risk-averse or risk-prone behaviour for the forager. A brief review of the recent literature on risk-sensitive foraging will be presented, focusing on results from the two experimental systems with which I have been involved: wild rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) foraging on artificial flowers; European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) foraging in operant boxes in the laboratory. It will be argued that to understand the foraging decisions of animals account needs to be taken of both the psychological mechanisms underlying decision-making and the fitness consequences of different decisions for the forager.},

  abstract = {Research on the acute and chronic effects of victimization by disaster has found that some patterns of response generalize across disasters of different origin and type. However, it is likely that variation in the nature of the victimizing event can affect long-term psychophysiological reactions. This study compared 23 flood victims with 27 people living near a leaking hazardous toxic waste dump and 27 control subjects. Self-report, behavioral, and physiological measures of stress were collected, all of which showed that 9 months after the announcement of the toxic hazard and the destructive flood, subjects living near the waste dump were more anxious, depressed, and alienated, less able to perform challenging tasks, and more aroused than were flood victims or control subjects. Residents of the landfill neighborhood also reported more feelings of helplessness than did any other subjects, and these feelings were significantly correlated with stress. Victimization associated with the toxic landfill appeared more likely to pose threats to victims' sense of control and to cause chronic emotional and psychophysiological problems than did the natural disaster.},

  abstract = {Background Researchers have studied psychological disorders extensively from a common cause perspective, in which symptoms are treated as independent indicators of an underlying disease. In contrast, the causal systems perspective seeks to understand the importance of individual symptoms and symptom-to-symptom relationships. In the current study, we used network analysis to examine the relationships between and among depression and anxiety symptoms from the causal systems perspective. Method We utilized data from a large psychiatric sample at admission and discharge from a partial hospital program (N = 1029, mean treatment duration = 8 days). We investigated features of the depression/anxiety network including topology, network centrality, stability of the network at admission and discharge, as well as change in the network over the course of treatment. Results Individual symptoms of depression and anxiety were more related to other symptoms within each disorder than to symptoms between disorders. Sad mood and worry were among the most central symptoms in the network. The network structure was stable both at admission and between admission and discharge, although the overall strength of symptom relationships increased as symptom severity decreased over the course of treatment. Conclusions Examining depression and anxiety symptoms as dynamic systems may provide novel insights into the maintenance of these mental health problems.},

From these three examples, I then attempt to articulate the major differences between dynamical approaches and more traditional symbolic and connectionist approaches. Although the three models reviewed here vary considerably in their details, they share a focus on the unfolding trajectory of a system's state and the internal and external forces that shape this trajectory, rather than the representational content of its constituent states or the underlying physical mechanisms that instantiate the dynamics. In some work, this dynamical viewpoint is augmented with a situated and embodied perspective on cognition, forming a promising unified theoretical framework for cognitive science broadly construed.},

Consistent with the lost opportunity principle, Study 1 revealed that regretted experiences in the most commonly regretted life domains are perceived as offering the least opportunity for improvement in the future, Study 2 indicated that people experience the most regret for outcomes that are not repeatable, and Study 3 revealed that perceptions of higher past than future opportunities and low psychological closure predict regret intensity.

To the contrary, this article asserts that archival region and time period studies are inconsistent themselves, that most of them are inadequate for testing curvilinearity, and that some of them are consistent with curvilinearity. Moreover, concomitant lab and field studies also provide evidence for a curvilinear relationship that is as robust as the linear relationship ostensibly is in archival studies. Thus, there is much more support for the negative affect escape model, and much less evidence against it, than Anderson has suggested.},

It appears to me to represent a real breakthrough in the art of dealing in 'unconventional' data. . . . I found the whole book both readable and enjoyable. It is suitable for data analysts, academic statisticians, and professional software writers."-Journal of the Royal Statistical Society"The book assumes a working knowledge of all of the principal results and techniques used in least squares multiple regression, as expressed in vector and matrix notation. Given this background, the book is clear and easy to use. . . . The techniques are illustrated in great detail with practical data sets from econometrics."-Short Book Reviews, International Statistical InstituteRegression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity provides practicing statisticians and econometricians with new tools for assessing quality and reliability of regression estimates. Diagnostic techniques are developed that aid in the systematic location of data points that are unusual or inordinately influential; measure the presence and intensity of collinear relations among the regression data; and help to identify variables involved in each and pinpoint estimated coefficients potentially most adversely affected. The book emphasizes diagnostics and includes suggestions for remedial action},

  abstract = {The problem of testing a point null hypothesis (or a "small interval" null hypothesis) is considered. Of interest is the relationship between the P value (or observed significance level) and conditional and Bayesian measures of evidence against the null hypothesis. Although one might presume that a small P value indicates the presence of strong evidence against the null, such is not necessarily the case. Expanding on earlier work [especially Edwards, Lindman, and Savage (1963) and Dickey (1977)], it is shown that actual evidence against a null (as measured, say, by posterior probability or comparative likelihood) can differ by an order of magnitude from the P value. For instance, data that yield a P value of .05, when testing a normal mean, result in a posterior probability of the null of at least .30 for any objective prior distribution. ("Objective" here means that equal prior weight is given the two hypotheses and that the prior is symmetric and nonincreasing away from the null; other definitions of "objective" will be seen to yield qualitatively similar results.) The overall conclusion is that P values can be highly misleading measures of the evidence provided by the data against the null hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Background. There are a large number of factors mediating suicide. Many studies have searched for a direct causal relationship between economic hardship and suicide, however, findings have been varied.Method. Suicide data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period between January 1968 and August 2002. These were correlated with a suite of macroeconomic data including housing loan interest rates, unemployment rates, days lost to industrial disputes, Consumer Price Index, gross domestic product, and the Consumer Sentiment Index.Results. A total of 51845 males and 16327 females committed suicide between these dates. There were significant associations between suicide rates and eleven macroeconomic indicators for both genders in at least one age range. Data was divided into male and female and five age ranges and pooled ages. Analyses were conducted on these 132 datasets resulting in 80 significant findings. The data was generally stronger for indices measuring economic performance than indices measuring consumers\&apos; perceptions of the state of the economy. A striking difference between male and female trends was seen. Generally, male suicide rates increased with markers of economic adversity, while the opposite pattern was seen in females. There were significantly different patterns in age-stratified data, with for example higher housing loan interest rates having a positive association with suicide in younger people and a negative association in older age groups.Conclusion. Macroeconomic trends are significantly associated with suicide. The patterns in males and females are very different, and there are further substantial age-related differences.},

  abstract = {The 25th-anniversary edition of Bernstein and Woodward's classic of investigative journalism.  In what must be the most devastating political detective story of the century, two young Washington Post reporters whose brilliant investigative journalism smashed the Watergate scandal wide open tell the whole behind-the-scenes drama the way it really happened.  The story begins with a burglary at Democratic National Committee headquarters on June 17, 1972. Bob Woodward, who was then working on the Washington Post's District of Columbia staff, was called into the office on a Saturday morning to cover the story. Carl Bernstein, a Virginia political reporter on the Post, was also assigned. The two men soon learned that this was not a simple burglary.  Following lead after lead, Woodward and Bernstein picked up a trail of money, secrecy and high-level pressure that led to the Oval Office and implicated the men closest to Richard Nixon and then the President himself. Over the months, Woodward met secretly with Deep Throat, now perhaps America's most famous still-anonymous source.  Here is the amazing story. From the first suspicions through the tortuous days of reporting and finally getting people to talk, the journalists were able to put the pieces of the puzzle together and produce the stories that won the Post a Pulitzer Prize. All the President's Men is the inside story of how Bernstein and Woodward broke the story that brought about the President's downfall. This is the reporting that changed the American presidency.},

The MoCA, a tool used widely in clinical geriatric practice to detect and quantify cognitive impairment, was administered to three diverse samples to assess the psychometric properties of the instrument. Participants were 482 healthy persons seen in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (CCLS), 1923 healthy volunteers evaluated by the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a population-based sample of Dallas County residents and 69 persons with known or suspected brain pathology, seen for clinical evaluation. The standard deviations in the CCLS and DHS groups were small (2.81, 3.87) and moderate in the clinical group (5.22). The corresponding raw coefficients alpha were. 50,. 63, and. 75. Thus, variability and internal consistency were associated. MoCA scores generally did not correlate with gender and correlated with age only in the clinical group. However, there were moderately strong positive correlations between MoCA scores and education in all three samples. The reliability of the MoCA was extremely low in the two non-clinical groups, but was high in the clinical group. Although useful in large non-clinical studies, the MoCA is best suited to detect and quantify cognitive impairment in clinical patients.},

Most of what is known about the possible effects of climate change on rural mental health relates to prolonged drought. But though drought is known to be a disproportionate and general stressor, evidence is mixed and inconclusive. Over time, like drought other weather-related disasters may erode the social and economic bases on which farming communities depend. Rural vulnerability to mental health problems is greatly increased by socioeconomic disadvantage. Related factors may compound this, such as reduced access to health services as communities decline and a ``stoical'' culture that inhibits help-seeking. Australia has the world's most variable climate and is a major global agricultural producer. Yet despite Australia's (and, especially, rural communities') dependence on farmers' well-being and success, there is very little\textemdash and inconclusive\textemdash quantitative evidence about farmers' mental health. The aim of this review is to consider, with a view to informing other countries, how climate change and related factors may affect farmers' mental health in Australia. That information is a prerequisite to identifying, selecting, and evaluating adaptive strategies, to lessen the risks of adverse mental health outcomes. The authors identify the need for a systematic epidemiology of the mental health of farmers facing increasing climate change\textemdash{} related weather adversity.},

We propose an explanatory framework to enhance consideration of how these effects may operate and to encourage debate about this important aspect of the health impacts of climate change. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: Climate change may affect mental health directly by exposing people to trauma. It may also affect mental health indirectly, by affecting (1) physical health (for example, extreme heat exposure causes heat exhaustion in vulnerable people, and associated mental health consequences) and (2) community wellbeing. Within community, wellbeing is a sub-process in which climate change erodes physical environments which, in turn, damage social environments. Vulnerable people and places, especially in low-income countries, will be particularly badly affected. CONCLUSIONS: Different aspects of climate change may affect mental health through direct and indirect pathways, leading to serious mental health problems, possibly including increased suicide mortality. We propose that it is helpful to integrate these pathways in an explanatory framework, which may assist in developing public health policy, practice and research.},

Startling statistics shape our thinking about social issues. But all too often, these numbers are wrong. This book is a lively guide to spotting bad statistics and learning to think critically about these influential numbers. Damned Lies and Statistics is essential reading for everyone who reads or listens to the news, for students, and for anyone who relies on statistical information to understand social problems.Joel Best bases his discussion on a wide assortment of intriguing contemporary issues that have garnered much recent media attention, including abortion, cyberporn, homelessness, the Million Man March, teen suicide, the U.S. census, and much more. Using examples from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other major newspapers and television programs, he unravels many fascinating examples of the use, misuse, and abuse of statistical information.In this book Best shows us exactly how and why bad statistics emerge, spread, and come to shape policy debates. He recommends specific ways to detect bad statistics, and shows how to think more critically about "stat wars," or disputes over social statistics among various experts. Understanding this book does not require sophisticated mathematical knowledge; Best discusses the most basic and most easily understood forms of statistics, such as percentages, averages, and rates.This accessible book provides an alternative to either naively accepting the statistics we hear or cynically assuming that all numbers are meaningless. It shows how anyone can become a more intelligent, critical, and empowered consumer of the statistics that inundate both the social sciences and our media-saturated lives.},

We grouped cases by altitude (low{$<$}1000 m; middle = 1000\textendash 1999 m; high{$\geq$}2000 m). Of reported suicides, 5\% were at high and 83\% at low altitude, but unadjusted suicide rates per 100,000 population were higher at high (17.7) than at low (5.7) altitude. High and low altitude victims differed with respect to race, ethnicity, rural residence, intoxication, depressed mood preceding the suicide, firearm use and recent financial, job, legal, or interpersonal problems. Even after multivariate adjustment, there were significant differences in personal, mental health, and suicide characteristics among altitude groups. Compared to low altitude victims, high altitude victims had higher odds of having family or friends report of a depressed mood preceding the suicide (OR 1.78; 95\%CI:1.46\textendash 2.17) and having a crisis within 2 weeks before death (OR 2.00; 95\%CI:1.63\textendash 1.46).

Design: Experts from a range of relevant disciplines received and considered a series of questions related to aspects of the topic. Setting: University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany. Method: The experts met and discussed the questions and arrived at a consensus. Conclusion: Total intake of glutamate from food in European countries is generally stable and ranged from 5 to 12 g/day (free: ca. 1 g, protein-bound: ca. 10 g, added as flavor: ca. 0.4 g). L-Glutamate (GLU) from all sources is mainly used as energy fuel in enterocytes. A maximum intake of 16.000 mg/kg body weight is regarded as safe. The general use of glutamate salts (monosodium-L-glutamate and others) as food additive can, thus, be regarded as harmless for the whole population. Even in unphysiologically high doses GLU will not trespass into fetal circulation. Further research work should, however, be done concerning the effects of high doses of a bolus supply at presence of an impaired blood brain barrier function. In situations with decreased appetite (e.g., elderly persons) palatability can be improved by low dose use of monosodium-L-glutamate.},

The first step was the derivation, from children's drawings of facial expressions of pain, of 5 sets of 7 schematic faces depicting changes in severity of expressed pain from no pain to the most pain possible. With the set of faces that achieved the highest agreement in pain ordering, additional studies were conducted to determine whether the set had the properties of a scale. In one study, children rank-ordered the faces on 2 occasions, separated by 1 week. All 7 faces were correctly ranked by 64\% (retest 1 week later, 61\%) of grade 1 children and by 86\% (retest 89\%) of grade 3 children. In a second study, the faces were presented in all possible paired combinations. All 7 faces were correctly placed by 62\% (retest 86\%) of the younger and by 75\% (retest 71\%) of the older subjects. A third study asked children to place faces along scale: a procedure allowing a check on the equality of intervals. The fourth study checked on whether pain was acting as an underlying construct for ordering the faces in memory. We asked whether children perceived the set as a scale by asking if memory for an ordered set of faces was more accurate than for a random set. The final study checked, with 6-year-old children, the test-retest reliability of ratings for recalled experiences of pain. Overall, the faces pain scale incorporates conventions used by children, has achieved strong agreement in the rank ordering of pain, has indications that the intervals are close to equal, and is treated by children as a scale. The test-retest data suggest that it may prove to be a reliable index over time of self-reported pain.},

Methods We test this proposition empirically using longitudinal survey data collected at five timepoints during the early outbreak of the virus in the US (N = 403). Results Multivariate growth curve analyses showed that, although conspiracy beliefs decreased and social distancing increased over time, people holding more conspiracy beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic showed the lowest increase in social distancing. Moreover, cross-lagged analyses demonstrated that people who reported more conspiracy beliefs at any wave tended to report less social distancing at the following wave. Conclusions Our findings show that COVID-19 conspiracy theories pose a significant threat to public health as they may reduce adherence to social distancing measures.},

  abstract = {``Complex'' is a special attribute we can give to many kinds of systems. Although it is used often as a synonym of ``difficult,'' it has a specific epistemological meaning, which is going to be shared by the incoming science of complexity. ``Difficult'' is an object which, by means of an adequate computational power, can be deterministically or stochastically predictable. On the contrary ``complex'' is an object which can not be predictable because of logical impossibility or because its predictability would require a computational power far beyond any physical feasibility, now and forever. For complexity refers to some observing system, it is always subjective, and thus it is defined as observed irreducible complexity. Human systems are affected by several sources of complexity, belonging to three classes, in order of descending restrictivity. Systems belonging to the first class are not predictable at all, those belonging to the second class are predictable only through an infinite computational capacity, and those belonging to the third class are predictable only through a trans-computational capacity. The first class has two sources of complexity: logical complexity, directly deriving from self-reference and G\"odel's incompleteness theorems, and relational complexity, resulting in a sort of indeterminacy principle occurring in social systems. The second class has three sources of complexity: gnosiological complexity, which consists of the variety of possible perceptions; semiotic complexity, which represents the infinite possible interpretations of signs and facts; and chaotic complexity, which characterizes phenomena of nonlinear dynamic systems. The third class coincides with computational complexity, which basically coincides with the mathematical concept of intractability. Artificial, natural, biological and human systems are characterized by the influence of different sources of complexity, and the latter appear to be the most complex.},

There were significant sex differences on the Empathy Quotient (EQ) (females on average scoring higher) and on the Systemizing Quotient (SQ) (males on average scoring higher), confirming earlier studies. Scientists also scored higher on the SQ, and scored lower on the EQ, compared to those in the humanities. Thus, independent of sex, SQ was a significant predictor of entry into the physical sciences. Results from questionnaire data and performance data indicate an S \&gt; E profile for physical science students as a group, and an E \&gt; S profile for humanities students as a group, regardless of sex. We interpret this as evidence that whilst on average males show stronger systemizing and females show stronger empathizing, individuals with a strong systemizing drive are more likely to enter the physical sciences, irrespective of their sex.},

  abstract = {The paper reviews the history, construction, and interpretation of modified Brinley plots, a scatter plot used in therapy outcome research to compare each individual participant's scores on the same dependent variable at Time 1 (normally pretreatment baseline; x-axis), with scores at selected times during or after treatment (y-axis). Since 1965 eponymously named Brinley plots have occasionally been used in experimental psychology to display group mean data. Between 1979 and 1995 a number of clinical researchers modified Brinley plots to show individuals' data but these plots have received little subsequent use. When constructed with orthogonal axes having the same origin and scale values, little or no change over time is shown by individuals' data points lying on or closely about the diagonal (450o) while the magnitude and direction of any improvement (or deterioration), outliers, and the extent of replication across cases shows via dispersion of points away from 450o. Interpretation is aided by displaying reliable change boundaries, clinical cutoffs, means, variances, confidence intervals, and effect sizes directly on the graph. Modified Brinley plots are directly informative about individual change during therapy in the context of concurrent change in others in the same (or a different) condition, clearly show if outcomes are replicated and if they are clinically significant, and make nomothetic group information, notably effect sizes, directly available. They usefully complement other forms of analysis in therapy outcome research.},

In the present paper we use Monte Carlo simulation to systematically examine the Type I error rate of F-test under heterogeneity. One-way, balanced, and unbalanced designs with monotonic patterns of variance were considered. Variance ratio (VR) was used as a measure of heterogeneity (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 2, 3, 5, and 9), the coefficient of sample size variation as a measure of inequality between group sizes (0.16, 0.33, and 0.50), and the correlation between variance and group size as an indicator of the pairing between them (1, .50, 0, -.50, and -1). Overall, the results suggest that in terms of Type I error a VR above 1.5 may be established as a rule of thumb for considering a potential threat to F-test robustness under heterogeneity with unequal sample sizes.},

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

In the current research, we explore whether adopting physical postures associated with power, or simply interacting with others who adopt these postures, can similarly influence sensitivity to pain. We conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants who adopted dominant poses displayed higher pain thresholds than those who adopted submissive or neutral poses. These findings were not explained by semantic priming. In Experiment 2, we manipulated power poses via an interpersonal interaction and found that power posing engendered a complementary (Tiedens \&amp; Fragale, 2003) embodied power experience in interaction partners. Participants who interacted with a submissive confederate displayed higher pain thresholds and greater handgrip strength than participants who interacted with a dominant confederate.},

Yet, climate change deniers and free-market activists are as staunchly opposed to market-based climate policy as they are to any other form of climate mitigation. In order to understand why climate change deniers reject market-based policy proposals, an archive of free-market environmental newsletters was analyzed for themes of economic opposition. This analysis revealed how climate change deniers rely upon the concept of a regulatory cartel to connect economic opposition to climate policy with attacks on scientific evidence. Because professional scientists do not operate under conventional private-market incentive structures, neoliberal climate change deniers frame scientific knowledge as an attack on economic freedom when utilized to guide policy governing environment\textendash economy relationships.},

Across samples from a developed economy Australia (n = 754), and a developing economy Mala\^wi (n = 387), we explored the factor structure of the `Causes of Third-World Poverty Questionnaire' (CTWPQ, D. Harper and colleagues, 1990). In addition to four core factors suggested through an original (N = 89) sample from the UK (Blame [1] the Poor, [2] Nature, [3] Third World governments, and [4] International Exploitation), combined Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) differentiate a possible fifth factor germane to the social marketing of aid, blame [5] Conflict. Australians and Mala\^wians differed significantly on all five factors, with Mala\^wians blaming poverty more on situations and less on the poor themselves, compared to Australian counterparts. Our findings are tentative because the CTWPQ item pool requires expanding to represent underlying constructs more fully. Nonetheless, instruments like the CTWPQ can in future be used to identify and monitor in-context psychosocial barriers to donation, enabling not-profit marketing organizations to raise funds more efficiently and effectively.

  abstract = {Causality was at the center of the early history of structural equation models (SEMs) which continue to serve as the most popular approach to causal analysis in the social sciences. Through decades of development, critics and defenses of the capability of SEMs to support causal inference have accumulated. A variety of misunderstandings and myths about the nature of SEMs and their role in causal analysis have emerged, and their repetition has led some to believe they are true. Our chapter is organized by presenting eight myths about causality and SEMs in the hope that this will lead to a more accurate understanding. More specifically, the eight myths are the following: (1) SEMs aim to establish causal relations from associations alone, (2) SEMs and regression are essentially equivalent, (3) no causation without manipulation, (4) SEMs are not equipped to handle nonlinear causal relationships, (5) a potential outcome framework is more principled than SEMs, (6) SEMs are not applicable to experiments with randomized treatments, (7) mediation analysis in SEMs is inherently noncausal, and (8) SEMs do not test any major part of the theory against the data. We present the facts that dispel these myths, describe what SEMs can and cannot do, and briefly present our critique of current practice using SEMs. We conclude that the current capabilities of SEMs to formalize and implement causal inference tasks are indispensible; its potential to do more is even greater.},

Local independence, expected value true scores, and nondeterministic functions of observed variables are three types of definitions for latent variables. These definitions are reviewed and an alternative ``sample realizations'' definition is presented. Another section briefly describes identification, latent variable indeterminancy, and other properties common to models with latent variables. The paper then reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined and used. It concludes with an evaluation of the different definitions of latent variables and their properties.},

The purposes of this article are threefold: (1) to explain how outliers can lead to improper solutions, (2) to use a confirmatory factor analysis example to demonstrate this, and (3) to encourage researchers to check for this possibility.},

This book discusses specialized models that, unlike standard methods underlying nominal categorical data, efficiently use the information on ordering. It begins with an introduction to basic descriptive and inferential methods for categorical data, and then gives thorough coverage of the most current developments, such as loglinear and logit models for ordinal data. Special emphasis is placed on interpretation and application of methods and contains an integrated comparison of the available strategies for analyzing ordinal data. This is a case study work with illuminating examples taken from across the wide spectrum of ordinal categorical applications. 1984 (0 471-89055-3) 287 pp. Regression Diagnostics Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity David A. Belsley, Edwin Kuh and Roy E. Welsch This book provides the practicing statistician and econometrician with new tools for assessing the quality and reliability of regression estimates. Diagnostic techniques are developed that aid in the systematic location of data points that are either unusual or inordinately influential; measure the presence and intensity of collinear relations among the regression data and help to identify the variables involved in each; and pinpoint the estimated coefficients that are potentially most adversely affected. The primary emphasis of these contributions is on diagnostics, but suggestions for remedial action are given and illustrated. 1980 (0 471-05856-4) 292 pp. Applied Regression Analysis Second Edition Norman Draper and Harry Smith Featuring a significant expansion of material reflecting recent advances, here is a complete and up-to-date introduction to the fundamentals of regression analysis, focusing on understanding the latest concepts and applications of these methods.

Features added to this Second Edition include the practical implications of linear regression; the Durbin-Watson test for serial correlation; families of transformations; inverse, ridge, latent root and robust regression; and nonlinear growth models.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Vasovagal reactions experienced by some blood donors (eg, faintness, lightheadedness, and dizziness) have been shown to be related to a decreased likelihood of future blood donations. This study evaluated the efficacy of audiovisual distraction as a means of reducing self-reported physiological reactions in first-time blood donors. Because interventions that are consistent with an individual's preferred coping style have been shown to be more effective at reducing physiological and psychological responses to stressful medical procedures, coping style (monitoring vs. blunting) was assessed as a possible moderating variable. METHODS: First-time blood donors were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: audiovisual distraction or no-treatment control. Participants in the distraction group donated blood at an American Red Cross blood drive while watching a three-dimensional video presentation on a personal visor and headset. The control group donated blood according to standard American Red Cross procedures. Score on a self-reported measure of physiological reactions completed immediately after donation served as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Individuals who typically use blunting coping strategies to cope with stress reported an attenuation of vasovagal reactions to blood donation in the distraction vs. the control condition (t(49) = 2.29, p {$<$} .05), whereas donors who prefer a monitoring coping style did not benefit from distraction. CONCLUSIONS: Among first-time blood donors, audiovisual distraction may be an effective means of reducing vasovagal reactions in donors who prefer to cope with stress using such strategies as distraction, denial, and reinterpretation.},

It is hypothesised that the intensity of recent and distant regrets will be predicted by different combinations of these predictors. Regression analyses on regrets reported by 957 French adults support this hypothesis. The intensity of recent regrets is predicted by the consequences of the behaviour, and especially so for actions. The intensity of distant regrets is predicted by the consequences of the behaviour and by its justification, the effect of justification being stronger for actions than for inactions.

To better interpret the origin of that uncertainty, we analyze the sensitivity of the tropical cloud radiative forcing to a change in sea surface temperature that is simulated by 15 coupled models simulating climate change and current interannual variability. We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature). This suggests that the simulation of the sensitivity of marine boundary layer clouds to changing environmental conditions constitutes, currently, the main source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedbacks simulated by general circulation models.},

Knowing what causes climate change, and what does not, is the most powerful predictor of both stated intentions to take voluntary actions and to vote on hypothetical referenda to enact new government policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying bogus causes (e.g., insecticides) correlates with the belief that the globe will warm, but is only weakly related to voluntary actions and not at all related to support for government policies. General pro-environmental beliefs and perceptions that global warming poses serious threats to society also help to explain behavioral intentions. The explanatory power of an air pollution framework is substantial in bivariate analyses, but has little explanatory power in multivariate analyses that include knowledge, risk perceptions, and general environmental beliefs. Translating public concern for global warming into effective action requires real knowledge. General environmental concern or concern for the negative effects of air pollution appear not to motivate people to support programs designed to control global warming.},

Additionally, the relationship of the normal distribution to interval measurement is commonly misunderstood, the latter existing by definition if a normal distribution exists. Concern with levels of measurements may mislead persons into attending to issues other than maximizing (utility, given) the particular limits of the state of the measurement art in the social sciences.},

This difference is argued to be purely epistemic in nature: We treat a variable as observed when the inference from data structure to variable structure can be made with certainty and as latent when this inference is prone to error. This difference in epistemic accessibility is argued to be directly related to the data-generating process, i.e., the process that produces the concrete data patterns on which statistical analyses are executed. For a variable to count as observed through a set of data patterns, the relation between variable structure and data structure should be (a) deterministic, (b) causally isolated, and (c) of equivalent cardinality. When any of these requirements is violated, (part of) the variable structure should be considered latent. It is argued that, on these criteria, observed variables are rare to nonexistent in psychology; hence, psychological variables should be considered latent until proven observed.},

The present review examines methodologies suited to identify such symptom networks and discusses network analysis techniques that may be used to extract clinically and scientifically useful information from such networks (e.g., which symptom is most central in a person's network). The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives. In addition, these techniques may offer possibilities to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

It is maintained that Schmidt and Hunter's arguments are based on mistaken assumptions. We discuss our critique of Schmidt and Hunter in terms of two arguments against a routine use of the correction for attenuation within the classical test theory framework: (1) corrected correlations do not, as Schmidt and Hunter claim, provide correlations between constructs, and (2) corrections for measurement error should be made using modern test theory models instead of the classical model. The arguments that Schmidt and Hunter advance in favor of the correction for attenuation can be traced to an implicit identification of true scores with construct scores. First, we show that this identification confounds issues of validity and issues of reliability. Second, it is pointed out that equating true scores with construct scores is logically inconsistent with the classical test theory model itself. Third, it is argued that the classical model is not suited for detecting the dimensionality of test scores, which severely limits the interpretation of the corrected correlation coefficients. It is concluded that most measurement problems in psychology concern issues of validity, and that the correction for attenuation within classical test theory does not help in solving them.},

Michell further argues that the hypothesis should be tested using additive conjoint measurement theory. Although relevant to classical test theory, Michell's arguments do not apply to psychometrics in general. In particular, they are largely irrelevant to item response theory models. We show that these models result from introducing probabilistic relations, which are needed to deal with measurement error, and not from a breakdown in critical inquiry, as Michell suggests. Moreover, at least one class of these models can be formulated in terms of additive conjoint measurement theory, which renders Michell's call for the additive conjoint model in need of qualification. Finally, item response theory models are routinely tested against empirical data, and although the assumption that an attribute is quantitative cannot be tested directly, such tests do address the conjunction of this assumption and other model assumptions. We conclude that, although Michell's arguments are important to psychological measurement, they are largely irrelevant to item response theory. In fact, we argue that they can be phrased in terms of this theory in a natural way.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies on risk and protective factors in heat wave-related deaths. Methods Using the OVID interface, we searched Medline (1966-2006) and CINHAL (1982-2006) databases. The Web sites of the World Health Organization, Institut National de Veille Sanitaire, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also visited. The search terms included heat wave, heat stroke, heatstroke, sunstroke, and heat stress disorders. Eligible studies were case-control or cohort studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and information on study quality were abstracted by 2 investigators independently. Six case-control studies involving 1065 heat wave-related deaths were identified. Results Being confined to bed (OR, 6.44; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-9.2), not leaving home daily (OR, 3.35; 95\% CI, 1.6-6.9), and being unable to care for oneself (OR, 2.97; 95\% CI, 1.8-4.8) were associated with the highest risk of death during heat waves. Preexisting psychiatric illness (OR, 3.61; 95\% CI, 1.3-9.8) tripled the risk of death, followed by cardiovascular (OR, 2.48; 95\% CI, 1.3-4.8) and pulmonary (OR, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.1) illness. Working home air-conditioning (OR, 0.23; 95\% CI, 0.1-0.6), visiting cool environments (OR, 0.34; 95\% CI, 0.2-0.5), and increasing social contact (OR, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.2-0.8) were strongly associated with better outcomes. Taking extra showers or baths (OR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.1-1.1) and using fans (OR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.4-1.1) were associated with a trend toward lower risk of death. Conclusion The present study identified several prognostic factors that could help to detect those individuals who are at highest risk during heat waves and to provide a basis for potential risk-reducing interventions in the setting of heat waves.},

  abstract = {In most published reports, discussing suicide problems, only mortality resulting from suicide attempts has been used as a basis for all statistical analyses. The main reason for this procedure is the great difficulty in obtaining accurate morbidity data with reference to suicide attempts. However, as the total number of suicides in a city or country represents 1/6 to 1/10 of the real number of suicide attempts, it is evident that all published conclusions must be accepted with the greatest possible reserve. Both authors were able to collect rather trustworthy data at the Municipal Medical Health Services (GG and GD) of the cities of The Hague, Amsterdam and Rotterdam and at the University Medical Centre at Leiden and Utrecht. Particularly the psychiatric departments of the GG and GD services in these three mentioned cities have an excellent record of most suicide attempts in these cities and a follow up system which enabled them to collect for each case, apart from name, sex, date of birth, marital status and religion, also date and hour of suicide, respectively suicide attempt, consequences of the attempts, method applied for the attempts (drugs, gas etc.), the possible reason for the attempt, number and dates of previous attempts, psychiatric diagnosis. These detailed records started in The Hague in 1954, in Rotterdam in 1959, in Amsterdam in 1961, in Utrecht and Leiden in 1965. Alltogether about 10,000 well described cases were collected by the authors and analysed for various purposes. Some of the major results of their analyses were the following: The average daily number of reported suicide attempts is usually less than one case a day, often even one case per 2 or 3 days.On certain days there is a sudden increase of 300 - 750\%, i.e. 2 to 5 cases per day. Alltogether 789 of such cluster days were observed.These DAILY FLUCTUATIONS in frequency of suicide attempts have no direct relationship with simple meteorological parameters such as environmental temperature, windspeed, hours of sunshine etc.However, there is a statistically significant relationship between cluster days and periods with strong atmospheric turbulence, accompanied by drastic changes in thermal balance (either cold or warm) and heavy precipitation (rain, snow or hail), causing serious thermoregulatory disturbances. They seem to trigger in subjects, predisposed to a serious mental disturbance, a suicide attempt. It is remarkable that no clusters occurred on the major holidays in The Netherlands, such as Saint Nicolas (5 December), Christmas and New Year.No consistent SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS were observed in the period 1954 to 1970. In The Netherlands as a whole and in Rotterdam in particular, the lowest suicide incidence occurs in January. In the case of suicide attempts January and February have usually the lowest values. The maximum number of suicide cases occurs in different years, in different months; however, suicide attempts are usually most frequent in the period September-November, the months with usually the greatest drastic meteorological disturbances.There is some evidence for YEARLY FLUCTUATIONS: SUICIDES in The Netherlands as a whole increased from 1955 till 1959, decreased till 1963, followed by a new increase till 1966 and a new decrease after 1966. SUICIDE ATTEMPTS in The Hague and Rotterdam show a similar pattern. The yearly number increases from 1955 (perhaps even earlier) till 1960 (The Hague) and 1961 (Rotterdam) followed by a decrease in 1962 and 1963. Since 1963 a new rise till the end of 1967 (in Rotterdam) and 1969 (in The Hague), followed in Rotterdam by a decrease in 1968 and 1969 and a new rise in 1970. No simple sociological explanation could be found for these long term fluctuations. It is worth mentioning that the DISTRIBUTION OF THE MONTHS OF BIRTH of subjects committing suicide attempts is entirely different from the pattern of the normal healthy population. The 10,000 subjects, who committed suicide in the period 1954 to 1970, were born most frequent in February and March, whereas in the normal population it is the month of May.},

In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {The importance of replication has been recognised across many scientific disciplines. Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability, because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods have not been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paper describes how two independent teams of researchers attempted to reproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, ``Shrinkage estimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect on forecasting accuracy'' (Miller \& Williams, 2003). The two teams proceeded systematically, reporting results both before and after receiving clarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams were able to approximately reproduce each other's results, but not those of Miller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in the conclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal damping outperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecasting methods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach to method documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code, as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitioners and researchers. The significance of this research lies not only in its lessons for seasonal forecasting but also, more generally, in its approach to the reproduction of forecasting research.},

  abstract = {Comments on an article by M. K. Jones et al. (see record 2012-06244-011). Recent years have seen the issue of climate change dominate the Australian political arena. Climate change represents a global environmental threat that has the potential to create emotional distress and anxiety about the future in vulnerable individuals. Hence, climate change is relevant to psychiatrists. Jones et al. reported that climate change concerns were directly related to checking compulsions in 28\% of their sample. The prominence of climate change concerns in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) highlights the way that sociocultural contexts can influence the expression of psychiatric disorders and calls for consideration of the potential underlying mechanisms. The study reported by Jones et al. focused only on OCD patients with checking compulsions. Checking compulsions involving climate change concerns can be understood in terms of the mechanisms that have been shown to play a role in checking compulsions in general. Checking compulsions have been associated with beliefs involving themes of increased responsibility and threat estimation, prevention of negative consequences and reduced memory confidence. Checking compulsions are frequently performed to prevent something bad or unpleasant from happening, and in accordance with this, Jones et al. described patients with climate change concerns who checked compulsively to prevent both immediate and long-term negative consequences. An example of an immediate concern related to fears that their pets would die from thirst, whereas an example of a concern about long-term consequences related to fears that their electricity use would increase carbon dioxide emissions. When assessing and treating patients with OCD, it is important to consider the relevant sociocultural factors as well as the underlying mechanisms that are likely to be involved. Sociocultural factors are always changing, but the underlying mechanisms of OCD are likely to remain the same. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis.

DESIGN--Postal survey using a questionnaire booklet together with a letter from the general practitioner. Non-respondents received two reminders at two week intervals. The SF-36 questionnaire was retested on a subsample of respondents two weeks after the first mailing. SETTING--Two general practices in Sheffield. PATIENTS--1980 patients aged 16-74 years randomly selected from the two practice lists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Scores for each health dimension on the SF-36 questionnaire and the Nottingham health profile. Response to questions on recent use of health services and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS--The response rate for the SF-36 questionnaire was high (83\%) and the rate of completion for each dimension was over 95\%. Considerable evidence was found for the reliability of the SF-36 (Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.85, reliability coefficient greater than 0.75 for all dimensions except social functioning) and for construct validity in terms of distinguishing between groups with expected health differences. The SF-36 was able to detect low levels of ill health in patients who had scored 0 (good health) on the Nottingham health profile. CONCLUSIONS--The SF-36 is a promising new instrument for measuring health perception in a general population. It is easy to use, acceptable to patients, and fulfils stringent criteria of reliability and validity. Its use in other contexts and with different disease groups requires further research.},

He presents chapters on the extent of homicide in the United States; explanations of the high rate; the slaying; the slain and the slayer; the negro and homicide; the punishment of homicide; homicide and other social phenomena; and seasonal variation in homicide. Every chapter definitely indicates further avenues for research. The work may be summarized as follows: In the United States one's life is far less safe than in European nations; any explanation of this phenomenon should take account of the influence of "folkways or culture patterns, most of them survivals of more barbarous days, when human life was little esteemed"; the high rate will probably remain high until there is "a marked improvement in the regulation of the sale and possession of concealed firearms"; the slayer is characteristically a "weakling in conflict, who is unable to solve his conflict except by the destruction of the one who thwarts him"; the issue concerning the negro and homicide is so much confused with other issues that a special investigation is urgently needed; punishment for homicide is far from swift and certain and is probably futile, and will remain so until public attitudes and values, especially those emphasizing the worth of human life, are appreciably changed; homicide seems to be associated with rapidly increasing population and the growth of cities; seasonal influences may possibly affect the homicide rate in the U. S., but the relationship is not established. Bibliography of 115 references.},

Regression Models begins with a discussion of the Tobit model and examines issues such as maximum likelihood estimation and the interpretation of parameters. The author next discusses the basic sample selection model and the truncated regression model. Elaborating on the modeling of censored and sample-selected data via maximum likelihood, he shows the close links between the models introduced and other regression models for non-continuous dependent variables, such as the ordered probit. Concluding with an exploration of some of the criticisms of these approaches and difficulties associated with them, this volume gives readers a guide to the practical utility of these models.

  abstract = {Reduction in carbon dioxide emissions constitutes a global public good; and hence there will be strong incentives for countries to free ride in the provision of CO2 emission reductions. In the absence of more or less binding international agreements, we would expect carbon emissions to be seriously excessive, and climate change problems to be unsolvable. Against this obvious general point, we observe many countries acting unilaterally to introduce carbon emission policies. That is itself an explanatory puzzle, and a source of possible hope. Both aspects are matters of `how politics works'\textendash{} i.e. `public choice' problems are central. The object of this paper is to explain the phenomenon of unilateral policy action and to evaluate the grounds for `hope'. One aspect of the explanation lies in the construction of policy instruments that redistribute strategically in favour of relevant interests. Another is the `expressive' nature of voting and the expressive value of environmental concerns. Both elements \textendash{} elite interests and popular (expressive) opinion \textendash{} are quasi-constraints on politically viable policy. However, the nature of expressive concerns is such that significant reductions in real GDP are probably not sustainable in the long term \textendash{} which suggests that much of the CO2 reduction action will be limited to modest reductions of a largely token character. In that sense, the grounds for hope are, although not non-existent, decidedly thin.},

To evaluate possible circannual variations in the major CSF monoamine metabolites and an array of neuropeptide measures, we analyzed data from 20 to 34 normal volunteers studied over a 3-year period. Data were analyzed for seasonal and cross-seasonal fluctuations by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni t tests when appropriate. The only statistically significant findings by ANOVA were for CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), both of which were lowest during spring and highest during summer. These spring-summer differences were statistically significant following Bonferroni t tests. These data support a growing body of evidence indicating a substantial seasonal effect on the serotonin system and suggest that any group analysis of SCF 5HIAA, and perhaps HVA, should take into account circannual variability.},

More specifically, our novel approach is to study the issue of validity based on the history of measurement in physics, which will lead to three concrete points that are relevant for the validity debate in psychology. First of all, studying the causal mechanisms underlying the measurements can be crucial for evaluating whether the measurements are valid. Secondly, psychologists would benefit from focusing more on the robustness of measurements. Finally, we argue that it is possible to make good science based on (relatively) bad measurements, and that the explanatory success of science can contribute to justifying the validity of measurements.},

  abstract = {Almost all human population exhibit seasonal variation in births, owing mostly to seasonal variation in the frequency of conception. This review focuses on the degree to which environmental factors like nutrition, temperature and photoperiod contribute to these seasonal patterns by acting directly on the reproductive axis. The reproductive strategy of humans is basically that of the apes: Humans have the capacity to reproduce continuously, albeit slowly, unless inhibited by environmental influences. Two, and perhaps three, environmental factors probably act routinely as seasonal inhibitors in some human populations. First, it seems likely that ovulation is regulated seasonally in populations experiencing seasonal variation in food availability. More specifically, it seems likely that inadequate food inatake or the increased energy expenditure required to obtain food, or both, can delay menarche, suppress the frequency of ovulation in the nonlactating adult, and prolong lactational amenorrhea in these populations on a seasonal basis. This action is most easily seen in tropical subsistence societies where food availability often varies greatly owing to seasonal variation in rainfall; hence births in these populations often correlate with rainfall. Second, it seems likely that seasonally high temperatures suppress spermatogenesis ecough to influence the incidence of fertilization in hotter latitudes, but possibly only in males wearing clothing that diminishes scrotal cooling. Since most of our knowledge about this phenomenon comes from temperate latitudes, the sensitivity of spermatogenesis in both human and nonhuman primates to heat in the tropics needs further study. It is quite possible that high temperatures suppress ovulation and early embryo survival seasonally in some of these same populations. Since we know less than desired about the effect of heat stress on ovulation and early pregnancy in nonhuman mammals, and nothing at all about it in humans or any of the other primates, this is an important area for future research. Thrid, correlational data suggest that there may be some degree of regulation of reproduction by photoperiod in humans at middle to higher latitudes. Populations at these latitudes often show a peak in presumed conceptions associated with the vernal equinox. On the other hand, evidence gathered by neuroendocrinologists tends to argue against reproductive photoresponsiveness in humans.},

Our main goals were to (1) investigate day-to-day relations between motivation and WM, (2) show that these relations differ between groups of younger and older adults, and (3) test whether the within-person and between-person structures linking motivational variables to WM are equivalent (i.e., the ergodicity assumption). The covariation between motivation and WM was generally positive in younger adults. In contrast, older adults showed reduced variability in motivation, increased variability across trials, and small reliability-adjusted correlations between motivation and WM. Within-person structures differed reliably across individuals, defying the ergodicity assumption. We discuss the implications of our findings for developmental theory and design, stressing the need to explore the effects of between-person differences in short-term covariations on long-term developmental change.},

A recent account hypothesised that a hyper-empathising `Extreme Female Brain' would be characterised in terms of psychosis. The present study tests this hypothesis by investigating the relationship between levels of empathising and systemising, as well as self-report measures of psychosis, depression and anxiety, in 70 healthy female undergraduates. Results showed a hyper-empathising profile was related to psychosis, and specifically paranoia and mania (positive symptoms). No relationship was found between hyper-empathising and either depression or anxiety, consistent with the idea that an `Extreme Female Brain' is specifically associated with psychosis. In addition, empathising and systemising were found to negatively correlate with each other, suggesting they are separate but related components.},

Researchers have created several short self-report measures of conspiracist ideation. These measures largely consist of items referring to an assortment of prominent conspiracy theories regarding specific real-world events. However, these instruments have not been psychometrically validated, and this assessment approach suffers from practical and theoretical limitations. Therefore, we present the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs (GCB) scale: a novel measure of individual differences in generic conspiracist ideation. The scale was developed and validated across four studies. In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis of a novel 75-item measure of non-event-based conspiracist beliefs identified five conspiracist facets. The 15-item GCB scale was developed to sample from each of these themes. Studies 2, 3 and 4 examined the structure and validity of the GCB, demonstrating internal reliability, content, criterion-related, convergent and discriminant validity, and good test-retest reliability. In sum, this research indicates that the GCB is a psychometrically sound and practically useful measure of conspiracist ideation, and the findings add to our theoretical understanding of conspiracist ideation as a monological belief system unpinned by a relatively small number of generic assumptions about the typicality of conspiratorial activity in the world.},

Method: Participants (n=404) were interviewed using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-IV-L; Brown et al., 1994), from which we analyzed interviewer ratings of panic attacks and panic attack symptoms, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Panic attacks in the context of Panic Disorder were characterized by a greater number and severity of symptoms compared to panic attacks in the context of Social Anxiety Disorder, and were associated with a history of traumatization, inpatient psychiatric treatment, and benzodiazepine use. Social anxiety panic attacks were associated with reduced physical health concerns. Cognitive panic attack symptoms were more prevalent in Panic Disorder and were associated with a variety of poor clinical correlates. Conclusions: Panic attacks in the context of Panic Disorder are more severe than those in social anxiety, and this may be driven by cognitive disturbances during those attacks.},

  abstract = {Conspiracy theories are ubiquitous when it comes to explaining political events and societal phenomena. Individuals differ not only in the degree to which they believe in specific conspiracy theories, but also in their general susceptibility to explanations based on such theories, that is, their conspiracy mentality. We present the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), an instrument designed to efficiently assess differences in the generic tendency to engage in conspiracist ideation within and across cultures. The CMQ is available in English, German, and Turkish. In four studies, we examined the CMQ's factorial structure, reliability, measurement equivalence across cultures, and its convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity. Analyses based on a cross-cultural sample (Study 1a; N = 7,766) supported the conceptualization of conspiracy mentality as a one-dimensional construct across the three language versions of the CMQ that is stable across time (Study 1b; N = 141). Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated cross-cultural measurement equivalence of the CMQ items. The instrument could therefore be used to examine differences in conspiracy mentality between European, North American, and Middle Eastern cultures. In Studies 2-4 (total N = 476), we report (re-)analyses of 3 datasets demonstrating the validity of the CMQ in student and working population samples in the UK and Germany. First, attesting to its convergent validity, the CMQ was highly correlated with another measure of generic conspiracy belief. Second, the CMQ showed patterns of meaningful associations with personality measures (e.g., Big Five dimensions, schizotypy), other generalized political attitudes (e.g., social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism), and further individual differences (e.g., paranormal belief, lack of socio-political control). Finally, the CMQ predicted beliefs in specific conspiracy theories over and above other individual difference measures.},

Meditators scored higher on all facets of the FFMQ-NL than the participants in the nonmeditating sample. For both samples, expected negative correlations between most mindfulness facets (all except for the Observing facet) and the constructs of alexithymia, thought suppression, rumination, worry, and dissociation were found. The Observing facet of the FFMQ-NL showed an unexpected positive correlation with thought suppression in the nonmeditating sample. Furthermore, as expected, mindfulness facets were negatively related to psychological symptoms, and all mindfulness facets except for Observing and Describing significantly predicted psychological symptoms. Overall, the Dutch FFMQ demonstrated favorable psychometric properties, commensurate with its (original) English language version.},

However, such experiments have yielded mixed results, possibly due to small sample sizes and heterogeneity of outcomes. Therefore, our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analyses on NIBS studies assessing the n-back task, which is a reliable index for WM. From the first data available to February 2013, we looked for sham-controlled, randomized studies that used NIBS over the DLPFC using the n-back task in PubMed/MEDLINE and other databases. Twelve studies (describing 33 experiments) matched our eligibility criteria. Active vs. sham NIBS was significantly associated with faster response times (RTs), higher percentage of correct responses and lower percentage of error responses. However, meta-regressions showed that tDCS (vs. rTMS) presented only an improvement in RT, and not in accuracy. This could have occurred in part because almost all tDCS studies employed a crossover design, possibly due to the reliable tDCS blinding. Study design was also associated with no improvement in correct responses in the active vs. sham groups. To conclude, rTMS of the DLPFC significantly improved all measures of WM performance whereas tDCS significantly improved RT, but not the percentage of correct and error responses. Mechanistic insights on the role of DLPFC in WM are further discussed, as well as how NIBS techniques could be used in neuropsychiatric samples presenting WM deficits, such as major depression, dementia and schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {How many underlying characteristics (or factors) does a set of survey questions measure? When subjects answer a set of self-report questions, is it more appropriate to analyze the questions individually, to pool responses to all of the questions to form one global score, or to combine subsets of related questions to define multiple underlying factors? Factor analysis is the statistical method of choice for answering such questions. When researchers have no idea beforehand about what factors may underlie a set of questions, they use exploratory factor analysis to infer the best explanatory model from observed data ``after the fact.'' If, on the other hand, researchers have a hypothesis beforehand about the underlying factors, then they can use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to evaluate how well this model explains the observed data and to compare the model's goodness-of-fit with that of other competing models. This article describes the basic rules and building blocks of CFA: what it is, how it works, and how researchers can use it. The authors begin by placing CFA in the context of a common research application\textemdash namely, assessing quality of medical outcome using a patient satisfaction survey. They then explain, within this research context, how CFA is used to evaluate the explanatory power of a factor model and to decide which model or models best represent the data. The information that must be specified in the analysis to estimate a CFA model is highlighted, and the statistical assumptions and limitations of this analysis are noted. Analyzing the responses of 1,614 emergency medical patients to a commonly-used ``patient satisfaction'' questionnaire, the authors demonstrate how to: 1) compare competing factor-models to find the best-fitting model; 2) modify models to improve their goodness-of-fit; 3) test hypotheses about relationships among the underlying factors; 4) examine mean differences in ``factor scores''; and 5) refine an existing instrument into a more streamlined form that has fewer questions and better conceptual and statistical precision than the original instrument. Finally, the role of CFA in developing new instruments is discussed.},

We conducted an experiment in which subjects read sentences from the 2007 IPCC report and assigned numerical values to the probability terms. The respondents' judgments deviated significantly from the IPCC guidelines, even when the respondents had access to these guidelines. These results suggest that the method used by the IPCC is likely to convey levels of imprecision that are too high. We propose an alternative form of communicating uncertainty, illustrate its effectiveness, and suggest several additional ways to improve the communication of uncertainty.},

The idea of applying permutation test ideas to PA leads to a quasi-inferential, non-parametric version of PA which accounts not only for finite-sample bias but sampling variability as well. We give evidence, however, that quasi-inferential PA based on normal random variates (as opposed to data permutations) is surprisingly independent of distributional assumptions, and enjoys therefore certain non- parametric properties as well. This is a justification for providing tables for quasi-inferential PA. Based on permutation theory, we compare PA of principal components with PA of principal factor analysis and show that PA of principal factors may tend to select too many factors. We also apply parallel analysis to so-called resistant correlations and give evidence that this yields a slightly more conservative factor selection method. Finally, we apply PA to loadings and show how this provides benchmark values for loadings which are sensitive to the number of variables, number of subjects, and order of factors. These values therefore improve on conventional fixed thresholds such as 0.5 or 0.8 which are used irrespective of the size of the data},

Here we undertake the first comprehensive examination of the potential impact of global climate change on armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. We find strong historical linkages between civil war and temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a roughly 54\% increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars. Our results suggest an urgent need to reform African governments' and foreign aid donors' policies to deal with rising temperatures.},

This practice can lead to distorted effect-size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

If it works with samples the size of typical national surveys, then MRP offers the possibility of analyzing many political phenomena previously believed to be outside the bounds of systematic empirical inquiry. Initial investigations of its performance with conventional national samples produce generally optimistic assessments. This article examines a larger number of cases and a greater range of opinions than in previous studies and finds substantial variation in MRP performance. Through empirical and Monte Carlo analyses, we develop an explanation for this variation. The findings suggest that the conditions necessary for MRP to perform well will not always be met. Thus, we draw a less optimistic conclusion than previous studies do regarding the use of MRP with samples of the size found in typical national surveys.},

However, less is known of the potential nonnormality of multivariate data although multivariate analysis is commonly used in psychological and educational research. Using univariate and multivariate skewness and kurtosis as measures of nonnormality, this study examined 1,567 univariate distriubtions and 254 multivariate distributions collected from authors of articles published in Psychological Science and the American Education Research Journal. We found that 74 \% of univariate distributions and 68 \% multivariate distributions deviated from normal distributions. In a simulation study using typical values of skewness and kurtosis that we collected, we found that the resulting type I error rates were 17 \% in a t-test and 30 \% in a factor analysis under some conditions. Hence, we argue that it is time to routinely report skewness and kurtosis along with other summary statistics such as means and variances. To facilitate future report of skewness and kurtosis, we provide a tutorial on how to compute univariate and multivariate skewness and kurtosis by SAS, SPSS, R and a newly developed Web application.},

To contribute data about replicability in economics, we replicated 18 studies published in the American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics between 2011 and 2014. All of these replications followed predefined analysis plans that were made publicly available beforehand, and they all have a statistical power of at least 90\% to detect the original effect size at the 5\% significance level. We found a significant effect in the same direction as in the original study for 11 replications (61\%); on average, the replicated effect size is 66\% of the original. The replicability rate varies between 67\% and 78\% for four additional replicability indicators, including a prediction market measure of peer beliefs.

Methods Consenting patients (N=125) were randomized to receive one of four influenza related messages (Facts Only; Facts and Myths; Facts, Myths, and Refutations; or CDC Control), mailed one week prior to a scheduled physician visit. Knowledge was measured using 15 true/false items at pretest and posttest; recall accuracy was assessed using eight items at posttest. Results All participants' knowledge scores increased significantly (p {$<$}0.05); those exposed to the CDC Control message had a higher posttest knowledge score (adjusted mean=11.18) than those in the Facts Only condition (adjusted mean 9.61, p={$<$}0.02). Participants accurately recalled a mean of 4.49 statements (sd=1.98). ANOVA demonstrated significant differences in recall accuracy by condition [F(3, 83)=7.74, p{$<$}.001, {$\eta$}2 = 0.22]. Conclusion Messages that include facts, myths, and evidence to counteract myths appear to be effective in increasing participants' knowledge. We found no evidence that presenting both facts and myths is counterproductive to recall accuracy. Practice Implications Use of messages containing facts and myths may engage the reader and lead to knowledge gain. Recall accuracy is not assured by merely presenting factual information.},

We demonstrate different ways that greater transparency of the research process in our field will accelerate scientific progress by increasing accuracy of reported research findings. Importantly, we make concrete recommendations for how relationship researchers can transition to greater disclosure of research practices in a manner that is sensitive to the unique design features of methodologies employed by relationship scientists. We discuss how to implement these recommendations for four different research designs regularly used in relationship research and practical limitations regarding implementing our recommendations and provide potential solutions to these problems.},

Research in psychology has shown that temperature significantly affects mood, and mood changes in turn cause behavioral changes. Evidence suggests that lower temperature can lead to aggression, while higher temperature can lead to both apathy and aggression. Aggression could result in more risk-taking while apathy could impede risk-taking. We therefore expect lower temperature to be related to higher stock returns and higher temperature to be related to higher or lower stock returns, depending on the trade-off between the two competing effects. We examine many stock markets world-wide and find a statistically significant, negative correlation between temperature and returns across the whole range of temperature. Apathy dominates aggression when temperature is high. The observed negative correlation is robust to alternative tests and retains its statistical significance after controlling for various known anomalies.},

  abstract = {Public perceptions of climate change are known to differ between nations and to have fluctuated over time. Numerous plausible characterizations of these variations, and explanations for them, are to be found in the literature. However, a clear picture has not yet emerged as to the principal trends and patterns that have occurred over the past quarter-century or the factors behind these changes. This systematic review considers previous empirical research that has addressed the temporal aspects to public perceptions. We address findings that have been obtained since the 1980s and using a range of methodologies. In this review, we consider early, seminal work examining public perceptions; survey studies carried out over long timescales and at an international scale; detailed statistical analyses of the drivers of changing perceptions; and qualitative research featuring a longitudinal component. Studies point to growing skepticism in the latter 2000s in some developed countries, underpinned by economic and sociopolitical factors. Even so, in many parts of the world, there has been growing concern about climate change in recent years. We conclude that the imbalance in the literature toward polling data, and toward studies of public perceptions in Western nations (particularly the United States), leaves much unknown about the progression of public understanding of climate change worldwide. More research is required that uses inferential statistical procedures to understand the reasons behind trends in public perceptions. The application of qualitative longitudinal methodologies also offers the potential for better appreciation of the cultural contexts in which climate change perceptions are evolving.

We integrate data obtained from discussion groups and a nationally representative survey, to interrogate and refine the concept of climate change scepticism with respect to the views of members of the public. We argue that two main types should be distinguished: epistemic scepticism, relating to doubts about the status of climate change as a scientific and physical phenomenon; and response scepticism, relating to doubts about the efficacy of action taken to address climate change. Whilst each type is independently associated by people themselves with climate change scepticism, we find that the latter is more strongly associated with a lack of concern about climate change. As such, additional effort should be directed towards addressing and engaging with people's doubts concerning attempts to address climate change.},

  abstract = {Short-term physiological requirements strongly constrain some foragers. During the limited time available for foraging, they must consume sufficient food to meet all energetic expenditures for 24 h. Models for risk-sensitive, decision-making predict that such a forager should be risk-averse toward reward variance when the animal expects to meet its requirement, and should be risk-prone toward reward variance when expecting an energetic deficit. Some previous demonstrations of this shift from risk-averse to risk-prone behaviour relied on differences in both pre-experimental deprivation and inter-trial delays within an experiment to vary the subjects' energy budgets, and these differences have allowed an alternate interpretation of observed preferences. Therefore, earlier work on risk-sensitive foraging in small birds was complemented by manipulating ambient temperature to induce positive and negative expected energy budgets. For a given mean reward, the inter-trial delay was the same, constant length at both temperatures. When subjects experienced a positive energy budget (warm temperature), risk-aversion exceeded preference for risk strikingly; the opposite occurred when the subjects could anticipate a negative energy budget (cold temperature). Variation in inter-trial delays could not have influenced the change in preference reported here.},

Previous studies have shown that healthy subjects learn to control local brain activity with operant training by using rtfMRI-based neurofeedback. In the present study, we investigated whether healthy subjects could voluntarily gain control over right anterior insular activity. Subjects were provided with continuously updated information of the target ROI's level of activation by visual feedback. All participants were able to successfully regulate BOLD-magnitude in the right anterior insular cortex within three sessions of 4~min each. Training resulted in a significantly increased activation cluster in the anterior portion of the right insula across sessions. An increased activity was also found in the left anterior insula but the percent signal change was lower than in the target ROI. Two different control conditions intended to assess the effects of non-specific feedback and mental imagery demonstrated that the training effect was not due to unspecific activations or non feedback-related cognitive strategies. Both control groups showed no enhanced activation across the sessions, which confirmed our main hypothesis that rtfMRI feedback is area-specific. The increased activity in the right anterior insula during training demonstrates that the effects observed are anatomically specific and self-regulation of right anterior insula only is achievable. This is the first group study investigating the volitional control of emotionally relevant brain region by using rtfMRI training and confirms that self-regulation of local brain activity with rtfMRI is possible.},

These findings can be paired with climate model output to generate projections of the impact future climate change may have on conflicts such as crime and civil war. However, there are large degrees of uncertainty in such projections, arising from (i) the statistical uncertainty involved in regression analysis, (ii) divergent climate model predictions, and (iii) the unknown ability of human societies to adapt to future climate change. In this article, we review the empirical evidence of the climate-conflict relationship, provide insight into the likely extent and feasibility of adaptation to climate change as it pertains to human conflict, and discuss new methods that can be used to provide projections that capture these three sources of uncertainty.},

The author describes his detailed findings resulting from reanalysis of more than 460 data sets from the factor-analytic literature, followed by a presentation of a hierarchical, three-stratum theory of cognitive ability and its implications for further research. A set of three computer disks (IBM 3-1/2" 1.4 megabytes, ASCII format) containing the numerical data sets and Dr. Carroll's statistical results is also available. Representing over 4 megabytes of data or roughly 2000 printed pages the disks are major resources for the interested researcher.},

According to the theory, social motives fall into 1 of 2 general categories\textendash those related to the acquisition of knowledge and those related to the regulation of emotion. When time is perceived as open-ended, knowledge-related goals are prioritized. In contrast, when time is perceived as limited, emotional goals assume primacy. The inextricable association between time left in life and chronological age ensures age-related differences in social goals. Nonetheless, the authors show that the perception of time is malleable, and social goals change in 20\textendash 83 yr olds when time constraints are imposed. The authors argue that time perception is integral to human motivation and suggest potential implications for multiple subdisciplines and research interests in social, developmental, cultural, cognitive, and clinical psychology.

Third, effect sizes can be reported along with measures of sampling error. Fourth, replication can be built into the design. The touting of insignificant results as significant because they are statistically significant is not likely to change until researchers break the stranglehold that statistical significance testing has on journal editors.},

  abstract = {The environmental movement has stood out compared to other movements through its future-oriented pessimism: dreams of a better or utopian future have been less important as a mobilizing tool than fear of future catastrophes. Apocalyptic images of future catastrophes still dominate much of environmentalist discourse. Melting polar caps, draughts, hurricanes, floods, and growing chaos are regularly invoked by activists as well as establishment figures. This apocalyptic discourse has, however, also been challenged\textemdash not only by a future-oriented optimism gaining ground among established environmental organizations, but also by the rise of what we call a postapocalyptic environmentalism based on the experience of irreversible or unavoidable loss. This discourse, often referring to the Global South, where communities are destroyed and populations displaced because of environmental destruction, is neither nourished by a strong sense of hope, nor of a future disaster, but a sense that the catastrophe is already ongoing. Taking our point of departure in the ``environmentalist classics'' by Rachel Carson and Barry Commoner, we delineate the contours of apocalyptic discourses in environmentalism and discuss how disillusionment with the institutions of climate governance has fed into increasing criticism of the apocalyptic imagery. We then turn to exploring the notion of postapocalyptic politics by focusing on how postapocalyptic narratives\textemdash including the utopias they bring into play, their relation to time\textendash space, and how they construct collective identity\textemdash are deployed in political mobilizations. We focus on two cases of climate activism\textemdash the Dark Mountain project and the International Tribunal for the Rights of Nature\textemdash and argue that mobilizations based on accepting loss are possible through what we call the paradox of hope and the paradox of justice.},

This article begins by investigating whether or not homicides are seasonal in S\~ao Paulo. Then, hypotheses based on the principles of routine activities theory are tested to evaluate the influence of weather and temporal variations on violent behaviour expressed as cases of homicides. Finally, the geography of space\textendash time clusters of high homicide areas are assessed using Geographical Information System (GIS) and Kulldorff's scan test. The findings suggest that central and peripheral deprived areas show the highest number of killings over the year. Moreover, homicides take place when most people have time off: particularly during vacations (hot months of the year), evenings and weekends. Overall, the results show that temporal variables are far more powerful for explaining levels of homicide than weather covariates for the Brazilian case\textemdash a finding that lends weight to the suggested hypotheses derived from routine activity theory.},

I argue that such expectations are misguided and inconsistent with evolutionary understandings of the brain as a computational organ. Rather, we should expect priming effects to be highly sensitive to variations in experimental features and subject populations. Such variation does not make priming effects frivolous or capricious but instead can be predicted a priori. However, absent theories specifying the precise contingencies that lead to such variation, failures to replicate another researcher's findings will necessarily be ambiguous with respect to the inferences that can be made. Priming research is not yet at the stage where such theories exist, and therefore failures are uninformative at the current time. Ultimately, priming researchers themselves must provide direct replications of their own effects; researchers have been deficient in meeting this responsibility and have contributed to the current state of confusion. The recommendations issued in this article reflect concerns both with the practice of priming researchers and with the inappropriate expectations of researchers who have failed to replicate others' priming effects.},

While the key ingredients of pre-study review and results-blind acceptance are far from novel \textendash{} and are already adopted independently in a variety of contexts \textendash{} Registered Reports are the first mechanism to combine them into a mainstream policy that has won appeal with multiple stakeholders in the research process. We review early evidence that Registered Reports are working as intended, while at the same acknowledging that they are not a universal solution for irreproducibility. We also consider how the policies and practices surrounding Registered Reports are changing, or must change in future, to address limitations and adapt to new challenges. In spite of these caveats, we conclude that Registered Reports are promoting reproducibility, transparency and self-correction across a wide range of disciplines, and may help reshape how society evaluates research and researchers.},

This work may seem to have had little impact on the environmental movement, but we disagree. Just as positive reinforcement and time-out have made their way into homes and schools, the idea of providing feedback and financial incentives to conserve energy appear to have found their way into the power companies (Darby, 2006). The terminology is not behavior analytic (Darby speaks of "information, action, and feedback in synergy," p. 9), but the ideas are certainly familiar to readers of this journal. The authors present smart and effective actions that society can use to deal with environmental problems. Among them are educating children, using politics to promote positive goals regarding the environment, and providing financial incentives for people to go green.

Their article represents an excellent summary of the seminal contributions of Harold Jeffreys to Bayesian induction. We comment on a method to extend Bayesian induction that places the emphasis on data rather than models. Models are always wrong, acting as approximations to the data from which they derive and thereby explaining some of the main factors operating in the experiment. Our simple extension places priors and posteriors on the possible distributions of data outcomes, one of which represents the true state of the world\textemdash the observed data is a sample from that unknown true state. The proposed system infers the probability that a given data distribution is the true one, based on the observed sample of data; the posterior probabilities that given model instances provide best approximations to the truth can then be obtained directly.},

  abstract = {Operationalism is based on the intuition that we do not know themeaning of a concept unless we have a method of measurement forit. It is commonly considered a theory of meaning which statesthat ``we mean by any concept nothing more than a set ofoperations; the concept is synonymous with the corresponding set ofoperations'' (Bridgman 1927, 5). That drastic statementwas made in The Logic of Modern Physics, published in 1927 by theAmerican physicist P. W. Bridgman. The operationalist point ofview, first expounded at length in that book, initially found manyadvocates among practicing physicists and those inspired by thetradition of American pragmatism or the new philosophy of logicalpositivism. It is highly doubtful that Bridgman intended toadvance a precise and universal theory of meaning, or any systematicphilosophical theory at all. His writings were primarily``reflections of a physicist''[1]rooted in experimental practice and aimed atarticulating the scientific method from a first-person point ofview. However, as Bridgman's ideas gained currency theywere shaped into a general philosophical doctrine of``operationalism'' or ``operationism'', and in thatform became very influential in many areas, especially inmethodological debates in psychology. Both in philosophy and inpsychology operationalism is nowadays commonly regarded as an extremeand outmoded position, but that is not to say that the potential ofBridgman's original ideas has been exhausted., This article has three sections, each of which serves a differentaim. Section 1 introduces Bridgman's key ideas onoperational analysis, explaining their motivations and tracing thecourse of their development. Section 2 summarizes variouscritiques of operationalism, which eventually led to a generalphilosophical consensus against it. Section 3 gives a view on theremaining potential of Bridgman's ideas on operational analysisfor philosophy of science today.},

  abstract = {In 1997\textendash 1998 a widespread economic crisis hit the economies of many East/Southeast Asian countries; its impact on suicide rates across the region has not been systematically documented. We investigated the impact of the Asian economic crisis (1997\textendash 1998) on suicide in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand. Suicide and population data for the period 1985\textendash 2006 were extracted from the World Health Organisation's mortality database and Taiwanese mortality statistics. Sex-specific age-standardised suicide rates for people aged 15 years or above were analysed using joinpoint regression. Trends in divorce, marriage, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and alcohol consumption were compared with trends in suicide rates graphically and using time-series analysis. Suicide mortality decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s but subsequently increased markedly in all countries except Singapore, which had steadily declining suicide rates throughout the study period. Compared to 1997, male rates in 1998 rose by 39\% in Japan, 44\% in Hong Kong and 45\% in Korea; rises in female rates were less marked. Male rates also rose in Thailand, but accurate data were incomplete. The economic crisis was associated with 10,400 more suicides in 1998 compared to 1997 in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. Similar increases in suicide rates were not seen in Taiwan and Singapore, the two countries where the economic crisis had a smaller impact on GDP and unemployment. Time-series analyses indicated that some of the crisis's impact on male suicides was attributable to increases in unemployment. These findings suggest an association of the Asian economic crisis with a sharp increase in suicide mortality in some, but not all, East/Southeast Asian countries, and that these increases were most closely associated with rises in unemployment.},

  abstract = {The thermoregulatory control of human skin blood flow is vital to the maintenance of normal body temperatures during challenges to thermal homeostasis. Sympathetic neural control of skin blood flow includes the noradrenergic vasoconstrictor system and a sympathetic active vasodilator system, the latter of which is responsible for 80\% to 90\% of the substantial cutaneous vasodilation that occurs with whole body heat stress. With body heating, the magnitude of skin vasodilation is striking: skin blood flow can reach 6 to 8 L/min during hyperthermia. Cutaneous sympathetic vasoconstrictor and vasodilator systems also participate in baroreflex control of blood pressure; this is particularly important during heat stress, when such a large percentage of cardiac output is directed to the skin. Local thermal control of cutaneous blood vessels also contributes importantly\textemdash local warming of the skin can cause maximal vasodilation in healthy humans and includes roles for both local sensory nerves and nitric oxide. Local cooling of the skin can decrease skin blood flow to minimal levels. During menopause, changes in reproductive hormone levels substantially alter thermoregulatory control of skin blood flow. This altered control might contribute to the occurrence of hot flashes. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the ability of skin blood vessels to dilate is impaired. This impaired vasodilation likely contributes to the increased risk of heat illness in this patient population during exposure to elevated ambient temperatures. Raynaud phenomenon and erythromelalgia represent cutaneous microvascular disorders whose pathophysiology appears to relate to disorders of local and/or reflex thermoregulatory control of the skin circulation.},

They include the use of theoretical formulas based on a fitted probability model (with or without a correction for parameter uncertainty), various "approximate" formulas (which should be avoided), and empirically based, simulation, and resampling procedures. The latter are useful when theoretical formulas are not available or there are doubts about some model assumptions. The distinction between a forecasting method and a forecasting model is expounded. For large groups of series, a forecasting method may be chosen in a fairly ad hoc way. With appropriate checks, it may be possible to base interval forecasts on the model for which the method is optimal. It is certainly unsound to use a model for which the method is not optimal, but, strangely, this is sometimes done. Some general comments are made as to why prediction intervals tend to be too narrow in practice to encompass the required proportion of future observations. An example demonstrates the overriding importance of careful model specification. In particular, when data are "nearly nonstationary," the difference between fitting a stationary and a nonstationary model is critical.},

An estimation procedure known as asymptotic distribution free (ADF), making no distributional assumption, has been suggested to avoid these biases. Corrections to the normal theory statistics to yield more adequate performance have also been proposed. This study compares the performance of a scaled test statistic and robust standard errors for two models under several non-normal conditions and also compares these with the results from ML and ADF methods. Both ML and ADF test statistics performed rather well in one model and considerably worse in the other. In general, the scaled test statistic seemed to behave better than the ML test statistic and the ADF statistic performed the worst. The robust and ADF standard errors yielded more appropriate estimates of sampling variability than the ML standard errors, which were usually downward biased, in both models under most of the non-normal conditions. ML test statistics and standard errors were found to be quite robust to the violation of the normality assumption when data had either symmetric and platykurtic distributions, or non-symmetric and zero kurtotic distributions.},

We conducted this study to investigate the risk of committing suicide between victims and non-victims after the 1999 Taiwan earthquake.Methods This population cohort study linked the National Health Insurance files, family registration, and death certificates. It consists of the 3 432 705 residents aged {$\geqslant$}15 years of central Taiwan, 1998\textendash 2000. They were stratified into victims (n = 301 327) and non-victims (n = 3 131 378). Victims refer to those who lost co-resident family members, were injured, or experienced property loss during the earthquake. Non-victims refers to all others. The suicide rate was calculated for the period 2\textendash 15 months after the earthquake. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated with logistic regression.Results After adjusting for residential location, age, gender, major disease status, and level of urbanization, we found that victims were 1.46 times more likely than non-victims to commit suicide following an earthquake (95\% CI: 1.11, 1.92).Conclusions Given the large study population and individual information available to identify victim status, this study was able to detect a statistically significant earthquake effect on suicide rate. This effect on suicide might be diluted if only geographically based stratification were possible, as opposed to victim status stratifications. Mental health programmes or other preventive strategies might be more effective by specifically targeting victims rather than by simply targeting individuals living in earthquake-affected areas.},

These levels have been accepted unquestioned from publications in social sciences dating from the 1940s and 1950s. The Stevens taxonomy has been used to prescribe appropriate symbolism (or analytical treatment) to each scale of measurement. This paper reviews the process by which these levels became a part of cartography, as well as subsequent literature that cartographers have all but ignored over the intervening four decades. The paper concludes that the four levels of measurement are not adequate to cover the circumstances of cartography, and that attribute issues alone do not provide a sufficient guide to symbolism or analytical treatment. A broader framework for measurement must be considered, including the relationships of control that constrain variation in one component to permit measurement of another. An informed use of tools does not depend on numbers alone, but on the whole ``measurement framework,'' the system of objects, relationships and axioms implied by a given system of representation.},

However, research has revealed that subjects who have participated in deception experiments versus nondeception experiments enjoyed the experience more, received more educational benefit from it, and did not mind being deceived or having their privacy invaded. Such evidence suggests that deception, although unethical from a moral point of view, is not considered to be aversive, undesirable, or an unacceptable methodology from the research participant's point of view. The repeated assumption of the unacceptability of deception seems to be due to the fact that deception has been evaluated only from the viewpoint of moral philosophizing. This has led to the repeated conclusion that deception is reprehensible and seems to have created a perceptual set to view deception immediately as aversive. However, the perception of the unethical nature of deception seems to be minimal in studies that investigate innocuous public behaviors and enhanced in studies that run the risk of harming research participants or in studies that investigate private behaviors. When this knowledge is combined with the fact that research participants do not mind being deceived, and that it can also be viewed as immoral not to conduct research on important problems, the scale seems to be tilted in favor of continuing the use of deception in psychological research.},

The first hypothesis, that play would relate to sensitization/repression, was tested using Pearson correlations. The second hypothesis, that interventions that were congruent with patients' coping styles would be more effective than incongruent interventions, was tested using MANCOVAs. Results: No relation was found between play and coping style. The "congruency hypothesis" was supported for self-reported distress immediately following the intervention. On behavioral distress variables, the interaction between sensitization/ repression and condition was contrary to the congruency hypothesis. Conclusions: Implications for future research and clinical intervention with pediatric populations were discussed.},

This volume articulates the accomplishments of the field and the points of disagreement, and gives the brain, clinical, and cognitive sciences an invaluable resource for 21st-century researchers. Citing and analyzing the results of experiments as well as field and case studies, the chapters are organized around methodological approaches, biological-evolutionary perspectives, and clinical perspectives, and bring together experts in neuroscience, and both cognitive and clinical psychology. Questions addressed include: * What is the nature of emotional events and what do we retain from them? * Is there something about emotional events that causes them to be processed differently in memory? * Do emotional memories have special characteristics that differ from those produced by "ordinary" memory mechanisms or systems? * Do people with emotional disturbances remember differently than normal people? * Which factors play the most crucial role in functional amnesia?},

Relationships with coping resources (self-efficacy, social support) and the impact of coping on psychological well-being were assessed. Coping strategies were measured using the Coping Across Situations Questionnaire (CASQ; Seiffge-Krenke, 1995). Results showed that adolescents' coping strategies differed according to problem domain. The most frequently used strategies were active and internally focused. Females used a wider range of coping strategies than did males. Significant correlations were found among coping strategies and coping resources. Moreover, the adoption of some strategies significantly affected adolescents' psychological well-being.},

  abstract = {Research consistently shows that right-wing ideological adherents are more likely to deny climate change. However, less is known about how right-wing ideological subtypes are uniquely related to climate change denial, as well as what explains these relationships. This study examines whether threat to the socioeconomic system in the form of climate change mitigation policies, referred to as Climate Change Mitigation Threat (CCMT), mediates the relationships between Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) subtypes and four forms of climate change denial (existence denial, human cause denial, impact denial and climate science denial). U.S. participants (N = 334; Mage = 34.70, SD = 5.98) were recruited via Amazon MTurk. When shared variance in the predictors was accounted for, we found that: (a) Conventionalism (RWA-C) positively predicted all forms of climate change denial; (b) Dominance (SDO-D) positively predicted existence denial; (c) Anti-Egalitarianism (SDO-E) positively predicted both human cause and impact denial; and (d) Aggression (RWA-A) negatively predicted existence denial. All significant direct relationships were partially mediated by CCMT, except for the direct paths between SDO-D and existence denial, and RWA-A and existence denial. These findings suggest that right-wing adherents who conform to societal norms and prefer unequal social systems may deny climate change partly due to a perception that mitigation strategies proposed to combat climate change threaten the existing socioeconomic system.},

In Study 1, the scale was developed and validated in an MTurk sample of 197. Exploratory factor analysis of our item pool revealed a four-factor structure, with cognitive-emotional impairment, functional impairment, behavioral engagement, and experience emerging as unique factors. Cognitive-emotional impairment and functional impairment were considered to constitute subscales for climate change anxiety; along with behavioral engagement, they were all related to experience as well as to negative emotions. Neither climate change anxiety nor general depression and anxiety were related to behavioral engagement. Study 2 replicated the factor structure as well as the pattern of correlations in a second MTurk sample of 199. Study 3 examined the relationship between climate change anxiety and adaptation responses in a sample of 217, and tested whether climate change anxiety scores would be affected by the framing of a climate change message. Overall, results suggest that climate change anxiety is not uncommon, especially among younger adults; that worry can be differentiated from a more serious impact on one's life; and that climate change anxiety is correlated with emotional but not behavioral responses to climate change.},

This issue was addressed by examining changes in low-level clouds over the Northeast Pacific in observations and climate models. Decadal fluctuations were identified in multiple, independent cloud data sets, and changes in cloud cover appeared to be linked to changes in both local temperature structure and large-scale circulation. This observational analysis further indicated that clouds act as a positive feedback in this region on decadal time scales. The observed relationships between cloud cover and regional meteorological conditions provide a more complete way of testing the realism of the cloud simulation in current-generation climate models. The only model that passed this test simulated a reduction in cloud cover over much of the Pacific when greenhouse gases were increased, providing modeling evidence for a positive low-level cloud feedback.},

With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.},

Rather than emphasizing the characteristics of offenders, with this approach we concentrate upon the circumstances in which they carry out predatory criminal acts. Most criminal acts require convergence in space and time of likely offenders, suitable targets and the absence of capable guardians against crime. Human ecological theory facilitates an investigation into the way in which social structure produces this convergence, hence allowing illegal activities to feed upon the legal activities of everyday life. In particular, we hypothesize that the dispersion of activities away from households and families increases the opportunity for crime and thus generates higher crime rates. A variety of data is presented in support of the hypothesis, which helps explain crime rate trends in the United States 1947-1974 as a byproduct of changes in such variables as labor force participation and single-adult households.},

The influence of these variables on domestic violence and rape is compared and it is found that the two types of crimes are affected in very different ways by the independent variables used. The results suggest that the occurrence of domestic violence is much more highly influenced by immediate temporal and weather variables such as time of day, day of week and ambient temperature.

These hypotheses were tested by obtaining cross-sectional data on I0 temperature indexes, 11 sociodemographic controls, percentage southern horn, and crime rates in more than 300 U.S. cities in 1990. Partial correlation analyses indicated that percentage southern born and sociodernographic variables rather than temperature predicted homicide rates. Moderator variable regression analyses indicated that relationships between temperature and nonhomicidal violence were stronger in small than large cities.

Under the influence of global warming, the mean climate of the Pacific region will probably undergo significant changes. The tropical easterly trade winds are expected to weaken; surface ocean temperatures are expected to warm fastest near the equator and more slowly farther away; the equatorial thermocline that marks the transition between the wind-mixed upper ocean and deeper layers is expected to shoal; and the temperature gradients across the thermocline are expected to become steeper. Year-to-year ENSO variability is controlled by a delicate balance of amplifying and damping feedbacks, and one or more of the physical processes that are responsible for determining the characteristics of ENSO will probably be modified by climate change. Therefore, despite considerable progress in our understanding of the impact of climate change on many of the processes that contribute to El Ni\~no variability, it is not yet possible to say whether ENSO activity will be enhanced or damped, or if the frequency of events will change.},

LSC is hypothesized to comprise of six subdomains: impulsiveness, preference for physical activities, risk seeking, self-centeredness, preference for simple tasks, and volatile temper. Using structural equation modeling, LSC was examined to determine if a global self-control measure or a multidimensional measure of its subdomains was a more salient predictor of violent and property crimes and drug use among adolescent male offenders (n\,=\,317). Only the multidimensional model adequately fit the data. Risk seeking predicted violent and property crimes, whereas volatile temper predicted violent crimes and drug use. The general theory of crime may obscure differences in the explanatory power of self-control subfactors for specific types of crime, especially within at-risk youth. Findings have implications for effective interventions among adolescent males with criminal histories.},

The theoretical rationale and empirical evidence for the role of reactive aggression in suicide is presented from the perspectives of neurobiology, psychopathology, and overt violent behavior. It is hypothesized that partner\textendash relationship disruptions amplify risk for suicide in the near term among reactive aggressive individuals, particularly those with psychiatric disorders, and preliminary evidence in support of this hypothesis is reviewed.

  abstract = {Introduction: It is widely recognized that extreme climatic conditions during summer months may constitute a major public health threat. Owing to what is called the "urban heat island effect," as well as to the consequences of heat waves on health, individuals living in cities have an elevated risk of death when temperature and humidity are high compared to those living in suburban and rural areas. Studies on heat wave-related mortality have further demonstrated that the greatest increases in mortality occur in the elderly. Following the unusually hot summer of 2003 and the dramatic news from neighboring countries such as France, the Italian Minister of Health requested the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\`a-Bureau of Statistics to undertake an epidemiologic study of mortality in Italy during Summer 2003 to investigate whether there had been an excess of deaths, with a particular focus on the elderly population. Materials and methods: Communal offices, which maintain vital statistics, were asked for the individual records of death of residents registered daily during the period 1 June-31 August 2003 and during the same period of 2002 for each of the 21 capitals of the Italian regions. As it was necessary to obtain mortality data quickly from many municipalities and to make the analysis as soon as possible, the method adopted was comparison of mortality counts during the heat wave with figures observed during the same period of the previous year. Results: Compared with 2002, between 1 June and 31 August 2003, there was an overall increase in mortality of 3134 (from 20,564 to 23,698). The greatest increase was among the elderly; 2876 deaths (92\%) occurred among people aged 75 years and older, a more than one-fifth increase (21.3\%, from 13.517 to 16.393\%). The highest increases were observed in the northwestern cities, which are generally characterized by cold weather, and in individuals 75 years and older: Turin (44.9\%), Trento (35.2\%), Milan (30.6\%), and Genoa (22.2\%). Of note are also the increases observed in two southern cities, L'Aquila (24.7\%) and Potenza (25.4\%), which are located, respectively, at 700 and 800 m above see level. For Bari and Campobasso, both in the South, with a typically hot summer climate, the increase during the last 15 days of August was 186.2 and 450\%, respectively. Conclusions: The relationship between mortality and discomfort due to climatic conditions as well as the short lag time give a clear public health message: preventive, social, and health care actions must be administered to the elderly and the frail to avoid excess deaths during heat waves.},

A survey of authors of those papers ( N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97\% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048001] 048001 ) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming (`no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97\% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.},

  abstract = {Scientific agreement on climate change has strengthened over the past few decades, with around 97\% of publishing climate scientists agreeing that human activity is causing global warming. While scientific understanding has strengthened, a small but persistent proportion of the public actively opposes the mainstream scientific position. A number of factors contribute to this rejection of scientific evidence, with political ideology playing a key role. Conservative think tanks, supported with funding from vested interests, have been and continue to be a prolific source of misinformation about climate change. A major strategy by opponents of climate mitigation policies has been to cast doubt on the level of scientific agreement on climate change, contributing to the gap between public perception of scientific agreement and the 97\% expert consensus. This ``consensus gap'' decreases public support for mitigation policies, demonstrating that misconceptions can have significant societal consequences. While scientists need to communicate the consensus, they also need to be aware of the fact that misinformation can interfere with the communication of accurate scientific information. As a consequence, neutralizing the influence of misinformation is necessary. Two approaches to neutralize misinformation involve refuting myths after they have been received by recipients (debunking) or preemptively inoculating people before they receive misinformation (prebunking). Research indicates preemptive refutation or ``prebunking'' is more effective than debunking in reducing the influence of misinformation. Guidelines to practically implement responses (both preemptive and reactive) can be found in educational research, cognitive psychology, and a branch of psychological research known as inoculation theory. Synthesizing these separate lines of research yields a coherent set of recommendations for educators and communicators. Clearly communicating scientific concepts, such as the scientific consensus, is important, but scientific explanations should be coupled with inoculating explanations of how that science can be distorted.},

  abstract = {Misinformation can have significant societal consequences. For example, misinformation about climate change has confused the public and stalled support for mitigation policies. When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the influence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identification of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and find that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. This comprehensive deconstruction and refutation of the most common denialist claims about climate change is designed to act as a resource for communicators and educators who teach climate science and/or critical thinking.},

Baron-Cohen's Empathizing\textendash Systemizing Theory of Sex Differences (E/S theory) suggests that male and female brains adopt different cognitive biases with male brains `systemizing' and female brains `empathizing'. We explored the relation between abilities that typically demonstrate male advantages and performance on Systemizing Quotient (SQ), Empathizing Quotient (EQ) and `Reading the Mind in the Eyes' (RMET). We hypothesized men should demonstrate superior performance on targeting, MROT and SQ task/questionnaire and that women should demonstrate superior performance on EQ and RMET. Significant sex differences were found for SQ, EQ, targeting and MROT, but not for RMET. Regression indicated that MROT was significantly predicted by higher SQ, lower EQ and unexpectedly, higher RMET scores. Regression indicated that individuals high in EQ and low in SQ were less accurate on the targeting task with their dominant hand, although high SQ individuals tended to be more accurate on targeting with their non-dominant hand. No relation between targeting and RMET scores was found. Thus, the E/S theory provides predictive power for spatial tasks that typically show male advantages.},

For example, public misconceptions about climate change can lead to lowered acceptance of the reality of climate change and lowered support for mitigation policies. This study experimentally explored the impact of misinformation about climate change and tested several pre-emptive interventions designed to reduce the influence of misinformation. We found that false-balance media coverage (giving contrarian views equal voice with climate scientists) lowered perceived consensus overall, although the effect was greater among free-market supporters. Likewise, misinformation that confuses people about the level of scientific agreement regarding anthropogenic global warming (AGW) had a polarizing effect, with free-market supporters reducing their acceptance of AGW and those with low free-market support increasing their acceptance of AGW. However, we found that inoculating messages that (1) explain the flawed argumentation technique used in the misinformation or that (2) highlight the scientific consensus on climate change were effective in neutralizing those adverse effects of misinformation. We recommend that climate communication messages should take into account ways in which scientific content can be distorted, and include pre-emptive inoculation messages.},

We find that 66.4\% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6\% endorsed AGW, 0.7\% rejected AGW and 0.3\% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1\% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5\%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2\% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors' self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.},

Are out-of-body experiences possible? Can we trust our intuitions? To some, the answer to all these questions might well be a resounding 'no', but to many people these represent serious beliefs about the mind and brain - beliefs that drive their everyday behaviour, beliefs that cost them huge amounts of money. Whole industries have developed founded on these dubious claims about the mind and brain. Even major corporations have dabbled with assessment methods such as those advocated by graphology, accepting and rejecting candidates on the basic of their handwriting. Expectant parents buy books and tapes by the dozen showing them how to improve the intelligence of their child by playing them classical music. People subscribe to expensive therapies founded on beliefs rather than science, or risk their health buying books that tell them how they can conquer illness through positive thinking, perhaps at the expense of more scientifically proven treatments. Tall Tales about the Mind and Brain presents a sweeping survey of common myths about the mind and brain. In a lighthearted and accessible style, it exposes the truth behind these beliefs, how they are perpetuated, why people believe them, and why they might even exist in the first place.},

Violent crime correlated significantly with temperature; nonviolent crime did not. This relationship was linear in the first study, but curvilinear in the second. Inspection of the data suggests that the incidence of aggressive behavior (i.e., violent crime) does not drop off in the mid-80s as laboratory findings and Baron and Ransberger's results would suggest, but continues to increase as temperatures rise into the 90s.

Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but to date has yielded relatively little of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of 13 convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all of the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure that they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parameterizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.},

Females are somewhat more likely to volunteer than males, and, generally, extraverts are more likely to volunteer than introverts. However, a logistic regression analysis showed that Neuroticism-Stability interacts with Extraversion-Introversion to increase or decrease the probability of volunteering. The results may have important implications for research findings based on data collected from volunteer subjects.},

  abstract = {Count data reflect the number of occurrences of a behavior in a fixed period of time (e.g., number of aggressive acts by children during a playground period). In cases in which the outcome variable is a count with a low arithmetic mean (typically {$<$} 10), standard ordinary least squares regression may produce biased results. We provide an introduction to regression models that provide appropriate analyses for count data. We introduce standard Poisson regression with an example and discuss its interpretation. Two variants of Poisson regression, overdispersed Poisson regression and negative binomial regression, are introduced that may provide more optimal results when a key assumption of standard Poisson regression is violated. We also discuss the problems of excess zeros in which a subgroup of respondents who would never display the behavior are included in the sample and truncated zeros in which respondents who have a zero count are excluded by the sampling plan. We provide computer syntax for our illustrations in SAS and SPSS. The Poisson family of regression models provides improved and now easy to implement analyses of count data.

  abstract = {In one currently dominant view on personality, personality dimensions (e.g. extraversion) are causes of human behaviour, and personality inventory items (e.g. `I like to go to parties' and `I like people') are measurements of these dimensions. In this view, responses to extraversion items correlate because they measure the same latent dimension. In this paper, we challenge this way of thinking and offer an alternative perspective on personality as a system of connected affective, cognitive and behavioural components. We hypothesize that these components do not hang together because they measure the same underlying dimension; they do so because they depend on one another directly for causal, homeostatic or logical reasons (e.g. if one does not like people and it is harder to enjoy parties). From this `network perspective', personality dimensions emerge out of the connectivity structure that exists between the various components of personality. After outlining the network theory, we illustrate how it applies to personality research in four domains: (i) the overall organization of personality components; (ii) the distinction between state and trait; (iii) the genetic architecture of personality; and (iv) the relation between personality and psychopathology.

The tension between the two kinds of replication is a tension of values\textemdash exact replications value confidence in operationalizations; their requirement tends to favor the status quo. Conceptual replications value confidence in theory; their use tends to favor rapid progress over ferreting out error. We describe the many ways in which conceptual replications can be superior to direct replications. We further argue that the social system of science is quite robust to these threats and is self-correcting.},

A possible mechanism for reactance in opposition to persuasion attempts involves people anticipating greater regret for negative outcomes after complying with an agent of persuasion than for negative outcomes after reacting against an agent of persuasion. Some participants were asked to anticipate regret prior to making a behavioral choice in the face of an influence attempt. These participants anticipated greater regret for negative outcomes that would be experienced after reacting against rather than complying with the influence attempt. Accordingly, these participants subsequently exhibited behavioral compliance. On the other hand, participants who made choices without explicitly being asked to anticipate possible future regret showed far greater reactance. Interestingly, in all cases compliance led to significantly greater regret than did reactance once a negative outcome actually occurred. These data indicate that people do not spontaneously anticipate the regret that they may experience in an influence situation. Furthermore, when asked to anticipate such regret, they misanticipate their future feelings. The implications of complying with and reacting against the demands of others are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: We studied CSF 5-HIAA and HVA concentrations in violent suicide attempters and examined their relationship with depression, anxiety, and impulsivity. Methods: CSF 5-HIAA and HVA concentrations were determined very shortly after hospital admission and compared to those of a matched control population. Clinical evaluation was performed concomitantly; the level impulsivity was evaluated by the Impulsivity Rating Scale (IRS). Results: Twenty-three patients and 23 control subjects were included. According to the IRS, 14 patients were classified as impulsive, including all patients suffering from personality disorders, and 9 as nonimpulsive, with a main DSM-IIIR diagnosis of melancholia. CSF 5-HIAA concentrations in the suicide group were significantly lower than in control subjects. This difference was entirely due to the impulsive suicide attempters. There was an inverse correlation between the IRS score and CSF 5-HIAA (r = -.47, p = .02) and only a trend for HVA (r = -.41, p = .078) levels in the suicide group. Conclusions: This study of a group of violent suicide attempters distinguished a subgroup of patients diagnosed with personality disorder with high impulsivity scores and a subgroup of patients with the main diagnosis of severe depression. CSF 5-HIAA was significantly lower in impulsive violent attempters than in nonimpulsive violent attempters, therefore desintangling violence from impulsivity and linking this biologic abnormality to impulsivity.},

Tests divisible into distinct subtests should be so divided before using the formula. The index \$\$\textbackslash bar r\_\{ij\} \$\$ , derived from {$\alpha$}, is shown to be an index of inter-item homogeneity. Comparison is made to the Guttman and Loevinger approaches. Parallel split coefficients are shown to be unnecessary for tests of common types. In designing tests, maximum interpretability of scores is obtained by increasing the first-factor concentration in any separately-scored subtest and avoiding substantial group-factor clusters within a subtest.

However, this special issue has not acknowledged a crucial concern in the open data debate: the views and desires of participants. Participants are the backbone of psychological research and an important stakeholder in open data issues. We review research that has studied participants' opinions of open data and outline concerns regarding open data raised by some groups of participants. We conclude with recommendations, including a call to psychological researchers to move beyond opinion and instead to empirically examine the impact of open data. We believe psychology is a discipline uniquely poised to execute these recommendations and guide researchers' understandings of how to appropriately and ethically implement open data practices across multiple disciplines.

  abstract = {This is the first book to introduce the new statistics - effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis - in an accessible way. It is chock full of practical examples and tips on how to analyze and report research results using these techniques. The book is invaluable to readers interested in meeting the new APA Publication Manual guidelines by adopting the new statistics - which are more informative than null hypothesis significance testing, and becoming widely used in many disciplines. Accompanying the book is the Exploratory Software for Confidence Intervals (ESCI) package, free software that runs under Excel and is accessible at www.thenewstatistics.com. The book's exercises use ESCI's simulations, which are highly visual and interactive, to engage users and encourage exploration. Working with the simulations strengthens understanding of key statistical ideas. There are also many examples, and detailed guidance to show readers how to analyze their own data using the new statistics, and practical strategies for interpreting the results. A particular strength of the book is its explanation of meta-analysis, using simple diagrams and examples. Understanding meta-analysis is increasingly important, even at undergraduate levels, because medicine, psychology and many other disciplines now use meta-analysis to assemble the evidence needed for evidence-based practice. The book's pedagogical program, built on cognitive science principles, reinforces learning:   Boxes provide "evidence-based" advice on the most effective statistical techniques.  Numerous examples reinforce learning, and show that many disciplines are using the new statistics. Graphs are tied in with ESCI to make important concepts vividly clear and memorable. Opening overviews and end of chapter take-home messages summarize key points. Exercises encourage exploration, deep understanding, and practical applications. This highly accessible book is intended as the core text for any course that emphasizes the new statistics, or as a supplementary text for graduate and/or advanced undergraduate courses in statistics and research methods in departments of psychology, education, human development , nursing, and natural, social, and life sciences. Researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the new statistics, and future published research, will also appreciate this book. A basic familiarity with introductory statistics is assumed.},

As Frank Keil and Robert Wilson write, "When a cognitive activity is so ubiquitous that it is expressed both in a preschooler's idle questions and in work that is the culmination of decades of scholarly effort, one has to ask whether we really have one and the same phenomenon or merely different cognitively based phenomena that are loosely, or even metaphorically, related."  This book is unusual in its interdisciplinary approach to that ubiquitous activity. The essays address five basic questions about explanation: How do explanatory capacities develop? Are there kinds of explanation? Do explanations correspond to domains of knowledge? Why do we seek explanations, and what do they accomplish? How central are causes to explanation? The essays draw on work in the history and philosophy of science, the philosophy of mind and language, the development of concepts in children, conceptual change in adults, and reasoning in human and artificial systems. They also introduce emerging perspectives on explanation from computer science, linguistics, and anthropology.  Contributors: Woo-kyoung Ahn, William F. Brewer, Patricia W. Cheng, Clark A.

  abstract = {A core assumption of the standard multiple regression model is independence of residuals, the violation of which results in biased standard errors and test statistics. The structural equation model (SEM) generalizes the regression model in several key ways, but the SEM also assumes independence of residuals. The multilevel model (MLM) was developed to extend the regression model to dependent data structures. Attempts have been made to extend the SEM in similar ways, but several complications currently limit the general application of these techniques in practice. Interestingly, it is well known that under a broad set of conditions SEM and MLM longitudinal "growth curve" models are analytically and empirically identical. This is intriguing given the clear violation of independence in growth modeling that does not detrimentally affect the standard SEM. Better understanding the source and potential implications of this isomorphism is my focus here. I begin by exploring why SEM and MLM are analytically equivalent methods in the presence of nesting due to repeated observations over time. I then capitalize on this equivalency to allow for the extension of SEMs to a general class of nested data structures. I conclude with a description of potential opportunities for multilevel SEMs and directions for future developments.},

The past decade has given rise to a host of new and exciting analytic methods for studying between-person differences in within-person change. These methods are broadly organized under the term growth curve models. The historical lines of development leading to current growth models span multiple disciplines within both the social and statistical sciences, and this in turn makes it challenging for developmental researchers to gain a broader understanding of the current state of this literature. To help address this challenge, the authors pose 12 questions that frequently arise in growth curve modeling, particularly in applications within developmental psychology. They provide concise and nontechnical responses to each question and make specific recommendations for further readings.},

Positive symptoms of schizotypy, particularly the cognitive-perceptual factor, correlated positively with conspiracist beliefs. The best predictor of belief in conspiracies was delusional ideation. Consistent with the notion of a coherent conspiratorial mindset, scores across conspiracy measures correlated strongly. Whilst findings supported the view that belief in conspiracies, within the sub-clinical population, was associated with a delusional thinking style, cognitive-perceptual factors in combination accounted for only 32\% of the variance.},

  abstract = {This article reviews recent literature on drought of the last millennium, followed by an update on global aridity changes from 1950 to 2008. Projected future aridity is presented based on recent studies and our analysis of model simulations. Dry periods lasting for years to decades have occurred many times during the last millennium over, for example, North America, West Africa, and East Asia. These droughts were likely triggered by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with La Ni\~na-like SST anomalies leading to drought in North America, and El-Ni\~no-like SSTs causing drought in East China. Over Africa, the southward shift of the warmest SSTs in the Atlantic and warming in the Indian Ocean are responsible for the recent Sahel droughts. Local feedbacks may enhance and prolong drought. Global aridity has increased substantially since the 1970s due to recent drying over Africa, southern Europe, East and South Asia, and eastern Australia. Although El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), tropical Atlantic SSTs, and Asian monsoons have played a large role in the recent drying, recent warming has increased atmospheric moisture demand and likely altered atmospheric circulation patterns, both contributing to the drying. Climate models project increased aridity in the 21st century over most of Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Regions like the United States have avoided prolonged droughts during the last 50 years due to natural climate variations, but might see persistent droughts in the next 20\textendash 50 years. Future efforts to predict drought will depend on models' ability to predict tropical SSTs.

This important questions was answered only after more than half a century of innovation in both theory and instrumentation. Critical developments along this path included not only a better understanding of the fundamental properties of matter, but also: (a) the suggestion and first demonstration by Rutherford in 1904 that radioactivity might be used as a geological timekeeper; (b) the development of the first mass analyser and the discovery of isotopes by J. J. Thomson in 1914; (c) the idea by Russell in 1921 that the age of a planetary reservoir like the Earth's crust might be measured from the relative abundances of a radioactive parent element (uranium) and its daughter product (lead); (d) the development of the idea by Gerling in 1942 that the age of the Earth could be calculated from the isotopic composition of a lead ore of known age; (e) the ideas of Houtermans and Brown in 1947 that the isotopic composition of primordial lead might be found in iron meteorites; and (f) the first calculation by Patterson in 1953 of a valid age for the Earth of 4.55 Ga, using the primordial meteoritic lead composition and samples representing the composition of modern Earth lead. The value for the age of the Earth in wide use today was determined by Tera in 1980, who found a value of 4.54 Ga from a clever analysis of the lead isotopic compositions of four ancient conformable lead deposits. Whether this age represents the age of the Earth's accretion, of core formation, or of the material from which the Earth formed is not yet known, but recent evidence suggests it may approximate the latter.},

The purpose of this study was to quantify effects of weight loss by dieting on lipids and lipoproteins through the review method of meta-analysis. Results from the 70 studies analyzed indicated that weight reduction was associated with significant decreases (P less than or equal to 0.001) and correlations (P less than or equal to 0.05) for TC (r = 0.32), LDL-C (r = 0.29), VLDL-C (r = 0.38), and TG (r = 0.32). For every kilogram decrease in body weight, a 0.009-mmol/L increase (P less than or equal to 0.01) in HDL-C occurred for subjects at a stabilized, reduced weight and a 0.007-mmol/L decrease (P less than or equal to 0.05) for subjects actively losing weight. Our results indicate that weight reduction through dieting can be a viable approach to help normalize plasma lipids and lipoproteins in overweight individuals.},

Citations to articles were gathered from the Institute for Scientific Information after one year. Interventions Random assignment on online publication of articles published in 11 scientific journals to open access (treatment) or subscription access (control). Results Articles assigned to open access were associated with 89\% more full text downloads (95\% confidence interval 76\% to 103\%), 42\% more PDF downloads (32\% to 52\%), and 23\% more unique visitors (16\% to 30\%), but 24\% fewer abstract downloads (-29\% to -19\%) than subscription access articles in the first six months after publication. Open access articles were no more likely to be cited than subscription access articles in the first year after publication. Fifty nine per cent of open access articles (146 of 247) were cited nine to 12 months after publication compared with 63\% (859 of 1372) of subscription access articles.

  abstract = {Background In nutritional epidemiology, it is common to fit models in which several dietary variables are included. However, with standard instruments for dietary assessment, not only are the intakes of many nutrients often highly correlated, but the errors in the estimation of the intake of different nutrients are also correlated. The effect of this error correlation on the results of observational studies has been little investigated. This paper describes the effect on multivariate regression coefficients of different levels of correlation, both between the variables themselves and between the errors of estimation of these variables. Methods Using a simple model for the multivariate error structure, we examine the effect on the estimates of bivariate linear regression coefficients of (1) differential precision of measurement of the two independent variables, (2) differing levels of correlation between the true values of the two variables, and (3) differing levels of correlation between the errors of measurement of the two variables. As an example, the prediction of plasma vitamin C levels by dietary intake variables is considered, using data from the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC) Norfolk study in which dietary intake was estimated using both a food frequency questionaire (FFQ) and a 7-day diary (7DD). The dietary variables considered are vitamin C, fat, and energy, with different approaches taken to energy adjustment. Results When the error correlation is zero, the estimates of the bivariate regression coefficients reflect the precision of measurement of the two variables and mutual confounding. The sum of the observed regression coefficients is biased towards the null as in univariate regression. When the error correlation is non-zero but below about 0.7, the effect is minor. However, as the error correlation increases beyond 0.8 the effect becomes large and highly dependent on the relative precision with which the two variables are measured. At the extreme, the bivariate estimates can become indefinitely large. In the example, the error correlation between fat and energy using the FFQ appears to be over 0.9, the corresponding value for the 7DD being approximately 0.85. The error correlation between vitamin C and fat, and vitamin C and energy, appears to be below 0.5 and smaller for the 7DD than for the FFQ. The impact of these error correlations on bivariate regression coefficients is large. The effect of energy adjustment differs widely between vitamin C and fat. Conclusion High levels of error correlation can have a large effect on bivariate regression estimates, varying widely depending on which two variables are considered. In particular, the effect of energy adjustment will vary widely. For vitamin C, the effect of energy adjustment appears negligible, whereas for fat the effect is large indicating that error correlation close to one can partially remove regression dilution due to measurement error. If, for fat intake, energy adjustment is performed by using energy density, the partial removal of regression dilution is achieved at the expense of substantial reduction in the true variance.},

This study used a randomized controlled trial design to measure the impact of Project K, a New Zealand-based youth development program, on academic and social self-efficacy. Project K combines a 3-week wilderness adventure, a 10 day community service component, and 1 year of mentoring to promote positive growth in 14\textendash 15 year olds with low self-efficacy. At baseline, the evaluation included 600 Project K (46 \% female) and 577 Control participants (48 \% female) and revealed that Project K was effective in improving both social and academic self-efficacy from pre- to post-program with effects being sustained 1 year later. Parents' perceptions of changes in the participants' interpersonal skills supported these findings. Differential program effects were found across participant subgroups, particularly 1 year after program completion. The implications of these differences are discussed.},

We investigated 328 colonies of massive Porites corals from 69 reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia. Their skeletal records show that throughout the GBR, calcification has declined by 14.2\% since 1990, predominantly because extension (linear growth) has declined by 13.3\%. The data suggest that such a severe and sudden decline in calcification is unprecedented in at least the past 400 years. Calcification increases linearly with increasing large-scale sea surface temperature but responds nonlinearly to annual temperature anomalies. The causes of the decline remain unknown; however, this study suggests that increasing temperature stress and a declining saturation state of seawater aragonite may be diminishing the ability of GBR corals to deposit calcium carbonate.},

This formula involves the individual's remaining reproductive potential in his expected natural lifetime, plus the summated impacts of his continued existence on the remaining reproductive potentials of each of his kin, each weighted by the coefficient of relationship. In theory, this quantity should predict the extent to which self-preservation is optimally expressed in that individual. For asocial species, the value will vary from zero up to the maximal reproductive value observable, and the logic of the Medawar-Williams theory of senescence should apply directly. However, for highly social species like our own, it can be demonstrated that negative values can also obtain, given the conjunction of low residual reproductive potential and burdensomeness toward kin. Much empirical evidence suggests that outright self-destructiveness is often found in circumstances of such conjunction.},

  abstract = {Human suicide presents a fundamental problem for the scientific analysis of behavior. This problem has been neither appreciated nor confronted by research and theory. Almost all other behavior exhibited by humans and nonhumans can be viewed as supporting the behaving organism's biological fitness and advancing the welfare of its genes. Yet suicide acts against these ends, and does so more directly and unequivocally than any other form of maladaptive behavior. Four heuristic models are presented here to account for suicide in an evolutionary and sociobiological framework. The first model attributes suicide to the extraordinary development of learning and cultural evolution in the human species. Learning may make human behavior so independent of biological constraints that it can occasionally assume a form entirely contrary to the principles of biological evolution. The second model attributes suicide to a breakdown of adaptive mechanisms in extremely stressful novel environments. The third model involves kin and group selection, arguing that in limited circumstances suicide may occur because of beneficial effects it has on other, surviving individuals who share the suicidal individual's genes. The last model suggests that suicide should be tolerated by evolution when it has no effect on the gene pool. This model holds particular promise in accounting for aspects of suicide not attributable to culture. The evidence indicates that suicide is most common in individuals who are unlikely to reproduce and unable to engage in productive activity; such individuals are least capable of promoting their genes. A complete explanation of suicide may derive only from an analysis of its biological significance.},

We use a complete set of all onboard air rage incidents over several years from a large, international airline to test our predictions. Physical inequality on airplanes\textemdash that is, the presence of a first class cabin\textemdash is associated with more frequent air rage incidents in economy class. Situational inequality\textemdash boarding from the front (requiring walking through the first class cabin) versus the middle of the plane\textemdash also significantly increases the odds of air rage in both economy and first class. We show that physical design that highlights inequality can trigger antisocial behavior on airplanes. More broadly, these results point to the importance of considering the design of environments\textemdash from airplanes to office layouts to stadium seating\textemdash in understanding both the form and emergence of antisocial behavior.},

  abstract = {If an individual can learn to directly control activation of localized regions within the brain, this approach might provide control over the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate behavior and cognition and could potentially provide a different route for treating disease. Control over the endogenous pain modulatory system is a particularly important target because it could enable a unique mechanism for clinical control over pain. Here, we found that by using real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI) to guide training, subjects were able to learn to control activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a region putatively involved in pain perception and regulation. When subjects deliberately induced increases or decreases in rACC fMRI activation, there was a corresponding change in the perception of pain caused by an applied noxious thermal stimulus. Control experiments demonstrated that this effect was not observed after similar training conducted without rtfMRI information, or using rtfMRI information derived from a different brain region, or sham rtfMRI information derived previously from a different subject. Chronic pain patients were also trained to control activation in rACC and reported decreases in the ongoing level of chronic pain after training. These findings show that individuals can gain voluntary control over activation in a specific brain region given appropriate training, that voluntary control over activation in rACC leads to control over pain perception, and that these effects were powerful enough to impact severe, chronic clinical pain.},

  abstract = {When comparing two independent groups, psychology researchers commonly use Student's t-tests. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance underlie this test. More often than not, when these conditions are not met, Student's t-test can be severely biased and lead to invalid statistical inferences. Moreover, we argue that the assumption of equal variances will seldom hold in psychological research, and choosing between Student's t-test and Welch's t-test based on the outcomes of a test of the equality of variances often fails to provide an appropriate answer. We show that the Welch's t-test provides a better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and it loses little robustness compared to Student's t-test when the assumptions are met. We argue that Welch's t-test should be used as a default strategy.},

  abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of personality variables and contractile forces on magnitude estimates of pain unpleasantness and pain intensity during varying levels of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Thirty volunteers, according to their scores on a preferred coping-style questionnaire, were assigned to one of two groups, one designated "monitors" (information seekers) and the other designated "blunters" (information avoiders). All subjects were administered varying levels of two types of NMES, one causing both afferent stimulation and muscle contraction and one causing only afferent stimulation. Subjects judged the intensity and unpleasantness of each current type using magnitude estimation. Data were analyzed using a 2x2x2x3 (coping stylexcurrent typexpain descriptorxcurrent level) analysis of variance. The results indicated that the rate of increase of magnitude estimates for unpleasantness and pain intensity that corresponded to increases in current were dependent on (1) the preferred coping style of the subject, (2) whether the stimulus caused a muscle contraction, and (3) whether the subject was judging the intensity or the unpleasantness of the applied stimulus. Behavioral styles appear to affect how subjects characterize the discomfort associated with NMES, and involuntary muscle contractions contribute to the discomfort felt from NMES. These results suggest that interventions tailored to a preferred coping style may increase a subject's level of tolerance to NMES and thus provide a more beneficial treatment.},

The model uses the regression of an aggregate dose-response relationship between maximum temperature and excess heat-related deaths, based on the difference between observed and expected deaths. The model is validated by correlation and residual analysis. The mean annual heat-related mortality for the period 1980-1998 was between 5.4 and 6 deaths per 100,000 depending on the method used to calculate expected deaths. Both validation methods show that the model has a moderate to high accuracy in modelling heat-related deaths compared to the observed record.},

The increased frequency/intensity of heat waves is expected to increase heat-related mortality and illness. To quantify the climatic risks of heat-related mortality in Lisbon an empirical-statistical model was developed in Part I, based on the climate-mortality relationship of the summer months of 1980\textendash 1998. In Part II, scenarios of climate and population change are applied to the model to assess the potential impacts on public health in the 2020s and 2050s, in terms of crude heat-related mortality rates. Two regional climate models (RCMs) were used and different assumptions about seasonality, acclimatisation and the estimation of excess deaths were made in order to represent uncertainty explicitly. An exploratory Bayesian analysis was used to investigate the sensitivity of the result to input assumptions. Annual heat-related death rates are estimated to increase from between 5.4 and 6 (per 100,000) for 1980\textendash 1998 to between 5.8 and 15.1 for the 2020s. By the 2050s, the potential increase ranges from 7.3 to 35.6. The burden of deaths is decreased if acclimatisation is factored in. Through a Bayesian analysis it is shown that, for the tested variables, future heat-related mortality is most sensitive to the choice of RCM and least to the method of calculating the excess deaths.},

However, some of these reform attempts suffer from the same mistakes and over-generalizations they purport to address. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for more rigor and nuance in methodological reform. By way of example, we present a formal analysis of three common claims in the metascientific literature: (a) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (b) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (c) that exploratory projects are characterized by poor statistical practice. We show that none of these three claims are correct in general and we explore when they do and do not hold.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Much of what has been learned about publication bias comes from the social sciences, less from the field of medicine. In medicine, three studies have provided direct evidence for this bias. Prevention of publication bias is important both from the scientific perspective (complete dissemination of knowledge) and from the perspective of those who combine results from a number of similar studies (meta-analysis). If treatment decisions are based on the published literature, then the literature must include all available data that is of acceptable quality. Currently, obtaining information regarding all studies undertaken in a given field is difficult, even impossible.

However, work on subjective well-being indicates that over time, positive and negative affect are independent across persons. To reconcile this inconsistency, 2 dimensions are proposed for personal affective structure: the frequency of positive vs negative affect and the intensity of affect. In 3 studies, 68 undergraduates and 34 33\textendash 85 yr old community residents completed daily and momentary reports on their moods. In support of the intensity dimension, the correlations between positive and negative intensity were strong and positive in all 3 studies. The intensities of specific emotions across Ss were also highly correlated. Across the 3 studies the frequency and intensity of affect varied independently. Although average levels of positive and negative affect showed low correlations, this relation became strongly inverse when intensity was partialed out. Thus, the intensity dimension helps explain the relative independence of positive and negative affect. (29 ref)},

These properties help solve some (but not all) of the problems underlying the credibility crisis in psychology. The symmetry of the measure of evidence means that there can be evidence for H0 just as much as for H1; or the Bayes factor may indicate insufficient evidence either way. P -values cannot make this three-way distinction. Thus, Bayes factors indicate when the data count against a theory (and when they count for nothing); and thus they indicate when replications actually support H0 or H1 (in ways that power cannot). There is every reason to publish evidence supporting the null as going against it, because the evidence can be measured to be just as strong either way (thus the published record can be more balanced). Bayes factors can be B -hacked but they mitigate the problem because a) they allow evidence in either direction so people will be less tempted to hack in just one direction; b) as a measure of evidence they are insensitive to the stopping rule; c) families of tests cannot be arbitrarily defined; and d) falsely implying a contrast is planned rather than post hoc becomes irrelevant (though the value of pre-registration is not mitigated).},

The few widely publicized nonreplications have functioned as a welcome wake-up call, but they should not suggest initial findings to be false positives. Instead, they should inspire research on yet-to-be-identified moderators. I also argue that other criticism on behavioral priming, such as on the supposedly large effect sizes of behavioral priming experiments, is based on the disregard of theory in combination with premature or faulty logic.},

However, in this study we explore the circumstances under which maintaining social identities \textendash{} such as `substance user' \textendash{} may be harmful to health, and when a successful transition constitutes identity change, rather than maintenance. This prospective study examined social identities of 132 adults entering a drug and alcohol therapeutic community (TC) at admission, three fortnightly intervals and exit, as well as a representative subsample of 60 participants at follow-up. Repeated measures ANOVA results showed that user identity decreased significantly over time, such that 76\% of the sample decreased in user identity strength over the first month in the TC. At the same time, recovery identity ratings increased significantly over time, with 64\% of the sample staying the same or increasing their recovery identity ratings over the first month. Identity change, indexed by the change in the difference score between user identity and recovery identity over the treatment period, accounted for 34\% of the variance in drinking quantity, 41\% of the variance in drinking frequency, 5\% of the variance in other drug use frequency, and 49\% of the variance in life satisfaction at follow-up, after accounting for initial substance abuse severity and social identity ratings at entry to the TC. The findings indicate that moving from a substance using identity towards a recovery identity constitutes an important step in substance abuse treatment.},

Suicide is a complex behavioral endpoint, and a simple cause-and-effect model seems highly unlikely, but relationships with weather could yield important insight into the biopsychosocial mechanisms involved in suicide deaths. This study has been designed to test for a relationship between air temperature and suicide frequency that is consistent enough to offer some predictive abilities. Weekly suicide death totals and anomalies from Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1986-2009) and Jackson, Mississippi, USA (1980-2006) are analyzed for relationships by using temperature anomaly data and a distributed lag nonlinear model. For both analysis methods, anomalously cool weeks show low probabilities of experiencing high-end suicide totals while warmer weeks are more likely to experience high-end suicide totals. This result is consistent for Toronto and Jackson. Weekly suicide totals demonstrate a sufficient association with temperature anomalies to allow some prediction of weeks with or without increased suicide frequency. While this finding alone is unlikely to have immediate clinical implications, these results are an important step toward clarifying the biopsychosocial mechanisms of suicidal behavior through a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between temperature and suicide.{$<$}p /{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Language: en{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The subjects were a nonclinical sample of 518 self-described heterosexual transvestites, 78 marginal transvestites ("borderline transsexuals"), and 86 transsexuals living full-time as women. Using factor analyses, several hypotheses were tested concerning the factorial structure of cross-genderism. The best solution was a model wherein cross-genderism was seen as consisting of four correlated but independent factors: Cross-gender Identity, Cross-gender Feminization, Cross-gender Social/Sexual Role, and Cross-gender Sexual Arousal. Procedurally, 692 subjects were randomly divided into validation and cross-validation samples of equal size. A series of exploratory analyses and item selection processes was followed by a replication using the cross-validation sample; the replication results were nearly identical. Scale reliabilities were satisfactory as were three tests of goodness-of-fit for the four factor solution. Partial validation evidence was based on analyses of variance showing that each of the four factor means scores differs significantly across three self-reported levels of cross-genderism (transvestites, marginal transvestites, and transsexuals).},

A total of 1,119 suicide attempts were collected from hospital records between 1996 and 2001. A clear seasonal variation was seen in suicide attempts in the 15-24, 25-34, and over 65 age groups in men and in the 15-24, 25-34, and 35-44 age groups in women with peaks in the spring and summer. Suicide attempts were more frequent between the hours of 6:00-9:00 in males and 3:00-6:00 in females. People attempting suicide who have depression, anxiety, or a psychotic disorder usually attempt suicide in the summer. Whereas the monthly averages of humidity, ambient temperature, duration and intensity of sunlight were positively correlated with the number of monthly suicide attempts, cloudiness and atmospheric pressure were negatively correlated. In conclusion, we must keep in mind that suicides and suicide attempts are not only the effect of climatic changes and that the most important component is the individual's ability to deal with conflicts.},

However, attempts to quantify the scientific consensus on anthropogenic warming have met with criticism. For instance, Oreskes [2004] reviewed 928 abstracts from peer-reviewed research papers and found that more than 75\% either explicitly or implicitly accepted the consensus view that Earth's climate is being affected by human activities. Yet Oreskes's approach has been criticized for overstating the level of consensus acceptance within the examined abstracts [Peiser, 2005] and for not capturing the full diversity of scientific opinion [Pielke, 2005]. A review of previous attempts at quantifying the consensus and criticisms is provided by Kendall Zimmerman [2008].

However, little research has investigated the consequences of conspiracy belief, and to date, this research does not indicate that conspiracy belief fulfills people's motivations. Instead, for many people, conspiracy belief may be more appealing than satisfying. Further research is needed to determine for whom, and under what conditions, conspiracy theories may satisfy key psychological motives.},

Our review of the literature shows that conspiracy beliefs result from a range of psychological, political, and social factors. Next, how are conspiracy theories communicated? Here, we explain how conspiracy theories are shared among individuals and spread through traditional and social media platforms. Next, what are the societal risks and rewards associated with conspiracy theories? By focusing on politics and science, we argue that conspiracy theories do more harm than good. We conclude by suggesting several promising avenues for future research.},

Increased storm frequency and intensity related to climate change are exacerbated by such local factors as the growing occupation of floodplains, increased runoff from hard surfaces, inadequate waste management and silted-up drainage. One can distinguish four types of flooding in urban areas: localized flooding due to inadequate drainage; flooding from small streams within the built-up area; flooding from major rivers; and coastal flooding. ActionAid undertook participatory vulnerability analysis in five African cities, to explore local people's perceptions of why floods occur, how they adjust to them, who is responsible for reducing the flood risk and what action the community itself can take. While local people adapt to floods, recognition of local, national and international governments' and organizations' responsibility to act to alleviate flooding and its causes, especially the consequences of climate change, is urgently needed.},

Bargh, Chen, and Burrows' (1996) famous study, in which participants unwittingly exposed to the stereotype of age walked slower when exiting the laboratory, was instrumental in defining this perspective. Here, we present two experiments aimed at replicating the original study. Despite the use of automated timing methods and a larger sample, our first experiment failed to show priming. Our second experiment was aimed at manipulating the beliefs of the experimenters: Half were led to think that participants would walk slower when primed congruently, and the other half was led to expect the opposite. Strikingly, we obtained a walking speed effect, but only when experimenters believed participants would indeed walk slower. This suggests that both priming and experimenters' expectations are instrumental in explaining the walking speed effect. Further, debriefing was suggestive of awareness of the primes. We conclude that unconscious behavioral priming is real, while real, involves mechanisms different from those typically assumed to cause the effect.},

Regional and seasonal aspects of modelled surface temperature and precipitation are to a large extent simulated correctly. The main anomalies are related to the difficulty of incorporating New Zealand's orography appropriately and to the initial and lateral boundary conditions, which were supplied by the GCM. The largest anomalies occur over the Southern Alps, where the modelled temperatures are too low and where the amount of precipitation is too high. Many parts of the east coasts in both the North and South Island are too warm and too dry. Correlation patterns of temperature and precipitation with mean sea-level pressure differ considerably from the equivalent patterns constructed from NCEP data, but do show in general the dominant relationships between wind direction and temperature and precipitation.

Increasing public scientific literacy is unlikely to solve this, because increased scientific literacy does not guarantee increased acceptance of critical environmental issues (e.g. that climate change is occurring). We distinguish between scientific literacy (basic scientific knowledge) and endorsement of scientific inquiry (perceiving science as a valuable way of accumulating knowledge), and examine the relationship between people's endorsement of scientific inquiry and their support for pro-environment policy. Analysis of a large, publicly available dataset shows that support for pro-environment policies is more strongly related to endorsement of scientific inquiry than to scientific literacy among adolescents. An experiment demonstrates that a brief intervention can increase support for pro-environment policies via increased endorsement of scientific inquiry among adults. Public education about the merits of scientific inquiry may facilitate increased support for pro-environment policies.},

We find that although levels of concern are relatively high, they are highest in the UK compared to all other sampled countries. Pooled across countries, personal experience with the virus, individualistic and prosocial values, hearing about the virus from friends and family, trust in government, science, and medical professionals, personal knowledge of government strategy, and personal and collective efficacy were all significant predictors of risk perception. Although there was substantial variability across cultures, individualistic worldviews, personal experience, prosocial values, and social amplification through friends and family in particular were found to be significant determinants in more than half of the countries examined. Risk perception correlated significantly with reported adoption of preventative health behaviors in all ten countries. Implications for effective risk communication are discussed.},

Self-discipline measured in the fall accounted for more than twice as much variance as IQ in final grades, high school selection, school attendance, hours spent doing homework, hours spent watching television (inversely), and the time of day students began their homework. The effect of self-discipline on final grades held even when controlling for first-marking-period grades, achievement-test scores, and measured IQ.

Impulsive and aggressive behaviors have been proposed as risk factors for suicide, but it remains unclear whether their effect on the risk of suicide is at least partly explained by axis I disorders commonly associated with suicide, such as major depression. With a case-control design, a comparison of the level of impulsive and aggressive behaviors and the prevalence of associated psychopathology was carried out with control for the presence of primary psychopathology. METHOD: One hundred and four male suicide completers who died during an episode of major depression and 74 living depressed male comparison subjects were investigated with proxy-based interviews by using structured diagnostic instruments and personality trait assessments. RESULTS: The authors found that current (6-month prevalence) alcohol abuse/dependence, current drug abuse/dependence, and cluster B personality disorders increased the risk of suicide in individuals with major depression. Also, higher levels of impulsivity and aggression were associated with suicide. An analysis by age showed that these risk factors were more specific to younger suicide victims (ages 18-40). A multivariate analysis indicated that current alcohol abuse/dependence and cluster B personality disorder were two independent predictors of suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Impulsive-aggressive personality disorders and alcohol abuse/dependence were two independent predictors of suicide in major depression, and impulsive and aggressive behaviors seem to underlie these risk factors. A developmental hypothesis of suicidal behavior, with impulsive and aggressive behaviors as the starting point, is discussed.},

Using structural equation modeling, we found an indirect effect of participant gender, and both direct and indirect effects of stalking myth acceptance and gender role stereotyping on guilt ratings. Men and participants who endorsed more traditional gender role stereotypes were associated with adherence to stalking myth acceptance beliefs. Endorsement of particular stalking myth acceptance beliefs offers a partial explanation for why women and men differed on perceptions of the defendant's intent to cause danger and the victim's perceived fear and distress. Results provide insight into the efficacy of current anti-stalking legislation that relies on a juror's capacity to evaluate an `objective' interpretation (i.e., `reasonable person') standard of fear for intimate partner stalking.},

This is noteworthy given the numerous deficiencies of coefficient alpha documented in the psychometric literature. This mismatch between theory and practice appears to arise partly because users of psychological scales are unfamiliar with the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha and partly because alternatives to alpha are not widely known. We present a brief review of the psychometric literature on coefficient alpha, followed by a practical alternative in the form of coefficient omega. To facilitate the shift from alpha to omega, we also present a brief guide to the calculation of point and interval estimates of omega using a free, open source software environment.},

Such misconceptions are likely to delay actions that mitigate climate change. This paper tests a way to reduce these misconceptions through experience in a dynamic simulation. In a laboratory experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: description, where participants performed a CO2 stabilization (CS) task that provided them with a CO2 concentration trajectory over a 100~year period and asked them to sketch the corresponding CO2 emissions and absorptions over the same period; and experience, where participants performed the same task in a dynamic climate change simulator (DCCS), followed by the CS task. In both conditions, half of the participants were science and technology (STEM) majors, and the other half were non-STEM. Results revealed a significant reduction in people's misconceptions in the experience condition compared to the description condition. Furthermore, STEMs demonstrated better performance than non-STEMs. These results highlight the potential for using experience-based simulation tools like DCCS to improve understanding about the dynamics of climate change.},

In a laboratory experiment, carbon-tax consequences were presented to participants in one of two forms: a written description, where the probability, consequences, and timing were explicitly provided; and experience, where the probability, consequences, and timing were sampled through unlabeled buttons. Four problems were presented in each condition such that the probability of consequences was high or low and the timing was early or late. Results indicated that the proportion of wait-and-see choices was greater in experience than description. Furthermore, in both experience and description, the proportion of wait-and-see choices was greater when the probability was low rather than high. The difference in the proportion of wait-and-see choices between the low and high probability was amplified in experience and attenuated in description. Finally, there was no difference in the proportion of wait-and-see choices when the timing of climate consequences was early rather than late in both experience and description. These results are explained by people's risk and time preferences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

We applied small area models to Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. These models incorporated spatial and temporal smoothing and explicitly accounted for methodological changes to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System during this period.Results. We found large differences between counties in all measures of alcohol use: in 2012, any drinking prevalence ranged from 11.0\% to 78.7\%, heavy drinking prevalence ranged from 2.4\% to 22.4\%, and binge drinking prevalence ranged from 5.9\% to 36.0\%. Moreover, there was wide variation in the proportion of all drinkers who engaged in heavy or binge drinking. Heavy and binge drinking prevalence increased in most counties between 2005 and 2012, but the magnitude of change varied considerably.Conclusions. There are large differences within the United States in levels and recent trends in alcohol use. These estimates should be used as an aid in designing and implementing targeted interventions and to monitor progress toward reducing the burden of excessive alcohol use.},

For predicting belief in specific conspiracy theories, we applied Path analyses with a large convenience sample (N~=~883, 62\% women) of students from Norway, a highly gender egalitarian country, allowing us to consider the effects of mediators and gender moderation in a specified model. Schizotypal personality dimensions Odd Beliefs and Paranoid Ideation predicted different mediators, and their effects on belief in conspiracy theories were totally mediated. The mediating variables (SDO, RWA, PB, and CM) were all unique predictors of belief in conspiracy theories, with CM having the largest contribution for both sexes. Explorative analyses of the specified model across gender suggest that the model for men and women is not equivalent. Results are discussed in light of the predictive contribution of especially conspiracy mentality.},

One factor proposed to explain the ineffectiveness of retractions is that repeating misinformation during a correction may inadvertently strengthen the misinformation by making it more familiar. Practitioners are therefore often encouraged to design corrections that avoid misinformation repetition. The current study tested this recommendation, investigating whether retractions become more or less effective when they include reminders or repetitions of the initial misinformation. Participants read fictional reports, some of which contained retractions of previous information, and inferential reasoning was measured via questionnaire. Retractions varied in the extent to which they served as misinformation reminders. Retractions that explicitly repeated the misinformation were more effective in reducing misinformation effects than retractions that avoided repetition, presumably because of enhanced salience. Recommendations for effective myth debunking may thus need to be revised.},

  abstract = {Objective To identify methods to increase response to postal questionnaires. Design Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of any method to influence response to postal questionnaires. Studies reviewed 292 randomised controlled trials including 258 315 participants Intervention reviewed 75 strategies for influencing response to postal questionnaires. Main outcome measure The proportion of completed or partially completed questionnaires returned. Results The odds of response were more than doubled when a monetary incentive was used (odds ratio 2.02; 95\% confidence interval 1.79 to 2.27) and almost doubled when incentives were not conditional on response (1.71; 1.29 to 2.26). Response was more likely when short questionnaires were used (1.86; 1.55 to 2.24). Personalised questionnaires and letters increased response (1.16; 1.06 to 1.28), as did the use of coloured ink (1.39; 1.16 to 1.67). The odds of response were more than doubled when the questionnaires were sent by recorded delivery (2.21; 1.51 to 3.25) and increased when stamped return envelopes were used (1.26; 1.13 to 1.41) and questionnaires were sent by first class post (1.12; 1.02 to 1.23). Contacting participants before sending questionnaires increased response (1.54; 1.24 to 1.92), as did follow up contact (1.44; 1.22 to 1.70) and providing non-respondents with a second copy of the questionnaire (1.41; 1.02 to 1.94). Questionnaires designed to be of more interest to participants were more likely to be returned (2.44; 1.99 to 3.01), but questionnaires containing questions of a sensitive nature were less likely to be returned (0.92; 0.87 to 0.98). Questionnaires originating from universities were more likely to be returned than were questionnaires from other sources, such as commercial organisations (1.31; 1.11 to 1.54). Conclusions Health researchers using postal questionnaires can improve the quality of their research by using the strategies shown to be effective in this systematic review.},

In practice, tricks based on transformations, bias corrections, and so forth, are often used to improve their accuracy. The bootstrap confidence intervals discussed in this article automatically incorporate such tricks without requiring the statistician to think them through for each new application, at the price of a considerable increase in computational effort. The new intervals incorporate an improvement over previously suggested methods, which results in second-order correctness in a wide variety of problems. In addition to parametric families, bootstrap intervals are also developed for nonparametric situations.},

There is a brief discussion of objectivity in statistical analyses and of the difficulties of achieving objectivity within a Bayesian framework. The article ends with a list of practical advantages of Fisherian/frequentist methods, which so far seem to have outweighed the philosophical superiority of Bayesianism.},

Participants were 368 adults who participated regularly in sport/exercise and completed online measures of perfectionism, compulsive exercise and eating disorders. In support of the well-established link between perfectionism and eating disorders, clinical perfectionism predicted eating pathology both directly and indirectly mediated by compulsive exercise. In addition, there were also direct effects of clinical perfectionism on the avoidance/rule-driven behavior, weight control, and mood improvement subscales of the Compulsive Exercise Test (CET). There was a direct effect of the CET weight control subscale on eating pathology and a negative direct effect of the CET subscale mood improvement on eating pathology. Findings lend support to the cognitive behavioral model of compulsive exercise in which clinical perfectionism is conceptualized as related to eating disorders directly and indirectly through the mediation of compulsive exercise. Compulsive exercise was also found to have a direct effect on eating disorders. Compulsive exercise may be a symptom of eating pathology, rather than an antecedent, however causal inferences could not be established given the correlational design. Longitudinal research using cross-lagged panel designs to examine a bidirectional relationship between compulsive exercise and eating disorders is needed.},

  abstract = {G-factor models such as the bifactor model and the hierarchical G-factor model are increasingly applied in psychology. Many applications of these models have produced anomalous and unexpected results that are often not in line with the theoretical assumptions on which these applications are based. Examples of such anomalous results are vanishing specific factors and irregular loading patterns. In this article, the authors show that from the perspective of stochastic measurement theory anomalous results have to be expected when G-factor models are applied to a single-level (rather than a 2-level) sampling process. The authors argue that the application of the bifactor model and related models require a 2-level sampling process that is usually not present in empirical studies. We demonstrate how alternative models with a G-factor and specific factors can be derived that are more well-defined for the actual single-level sampling design that underlies most empirical studies. It is shown in detail how 2 alternative models, the bifactor-(S - 1) model and the bifactor-(S{$\cdot$}I - 1) model, can be defined. The properties of these models are described and illustrated with an empirical example. Finally, further alternatives for analyzing multidimensional models are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Different long-term trajectories in the decline of homicide can be distinguished between various European regions. Age and sex patterns in serious violent offending, however, have changed very little over several centuries. The long-term decline in homicide rates seems to go along with a disproportionate decline in elite homicide and a drop in male-to-male conflicts in public space. A range of theoretical explanations for the long-term decline have been offered, including the effects of the civilizing process, strengthening state powers, the Protestant Reformation, and modern individualism, but most theorizing has been post hoc.},

Conflicts occur in every domain of life: family, work, and society, local and global. Conflict management, therefore, is an essential competency for each person. People differ largely in their emotional and behavioral responses to conflict and need to learn how to behave effectively in different conflict situations. This requires a contingency approach, first assessing the conflict situation, and then choosing a strategy, matching the goals of the party. In most situations, fostering cooperative relations will be most beneficial; however, this is also most challenging. Therefore, constructive conflict management strategies, including trust building and methods of constructive controversy, are emphasized. Conflict management, however, is broader than the interaction of the conflicting parties. Third-party interventions are an essential element of constructive conflict management, particularly the assessment of which parties are intervening in what ways at what escalation stage.},

This study uses survey data collected from over 1200 Hurricane Katrina survivors to examine these influences on a wide array of responses, ranging from evacuation timing and emotional support to housing and employment situations and plans to return to pre-storm communities. Results reveal strong racial and class differences, indicating that neither of these dimensions can be reduced to the other when seeking to understand responses by survivors themselves. This intersection renders low-income black home owners from New Orleans those most in need of targeted assistance as residents work to put themselves and the region back together.},

Especially in clinical psychology and personality research, such psychological networks have been used to complement more traditional latent variable models. While prior publications have tackled the two topics of network psychometrics (how to estimate networks) and network inference (how to interpret networks), the topic of network stability still provides a major challenge: it is unclear how susceptible network structures and graph theoretical measures derived from network models are to sampling error and choices made in the estimation method, greatly limiting the certainty of substantive interpretation. In this tutorial paper, we aim to address these challenges. First, we introduce the current state-of-the-art of network psychometrics and network inference in psychology to allow readers to use this tutorial as a stand-alone to estimate and interpret psychopathological networks in R. Second, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to assess the stability of network parameters. To facilitate this process, we developed the freely available R-package bootnet. We apply bootnet, accompanied by R syntax, to a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online. We show how to estimate confidence intervals around edge weights, and how to examine stability of centrality indices by subsampling nodes and persons. This tutorial is aimed at researchers with all levels of statistical experience, and can also be used by beginners.},

This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance between test items arises from the influence of one or more common latent variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of the more general framework of structural equation modeling (SEM). In the first generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a network. We term this framework latent network modeling (LNM) and show that, with LNM, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second generalization, the residual variance\textendash covariance structure of indicators is modeled as a network. We term this generalization residual network modeling (RNM) and show that, within this framework, identifiable models can be obtained in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to fit, and compare, SEM models, network models, and the RNM and LNM generalizations. This methodology has been implemented in the free-to-use software package lvnet, which contains confirmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in simulation studies that these search algorithms perform adequately in identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks. We further demonstrate the utility of these generalizations in an empirical example on a personality inventory dataset.},

We argue that these networks can be directly applied in clinical research and practice as hypothesis generating structures. Two networks can be computed: a temporal network, in which one investigates if symptoms (or other relevant variables) predict one another over time, and a contemporaneous network, in which one investigates if symptoms predict one another in the same window of measurement. The contemporaneous network is a partial correlation network, which is emerging in the analysis of cross-sectional data but is not yet utilized in the analysis of time series data. We explain the importance of partial correlation networks and exemplify the network structures on time series data of a psychiatric patient.},

We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure on cross-sectional psychological data.

This assumes that all variables are measured without measurement error, which may be implausible. In addition, cross-sectional data cannot distinguish between within-subject and between-subject effects. This paper provides a general framework that extends GGM modeling with latent variables, including relationships over time. These relationships can be estimated from time-series data or panel data featuring at least three waves of measurement. The model takes the form of a graphical vector-autoregression model between latent variables and is termed the ts-lvgvar when estimated from time-series data and the panel-lvgvar when estimated from panel data. These methods have been implemented in the software package psychonetrics, which is exemplified in two empirical examples, one using time-series data and one using panel data, and evaluated in two large-scale simulation studies. The paper concludes with a discussion on ergodicity and generalizability. Although within-subject effects may in principle be separated from between-subject effects, the interpretation of these results rests on the intensity and the time interval of measurement and on the plausibility of the assumption of stationarity.},

Male to female ratio was 2.70:1 (p{$<$}0.0001). The female subgroup was significantly older than the male subgroup (p{$<$}0.0001). The monthly distribution revealed a bimodal pattern (p=0.01), particularly in men younger than 65 years, with an excess risk in April and September. This circannual pattern attenuated in the second half of the observation period as shown by adjusted Poisson regression. Monday and Tuesday proved to be high risk days for both sexes. For males and females, a bimodal diurnal distribution pattern with a morning and an evening peak was observed. While both sexes followed the same pattern in the winter half year, in summer females showed a pronounced excess risk in the morning hours while for men the evening peak was substantially amplified (p{$<$}0.0001). Risk assessment revealed a marked broadening by approximately 6 h of the time window in the summer half year compared to the winter half year.Limitations About 30\% of cases were excluded because of missing data on sex specification. However, cases with and without sex information did not differ significantly in the variables under investigation.Conclusion The analysis revealed marked seasonal, weekly and diurnal peaks of railway suicide intensity. Differences between men and women indicate sex-specific processes underlying their suicidal behaviour. The findings may increase alertness of railway and security personal for particular vulnerable time windows of excess risk for railway suicides.},

Negative affect, interpersonal and intergroup conflict, and possibly psychological distress increase with rising temperature. Droughts, floods, and severe storms diminish quality of life, elevate stress, produce psychological distress, and may elevate interpersonal and intergroup conflict. Recreational opportunities are compromised by extreme weather, and children may suffer delayed cognitive development. Elevated pollutants concern citizens and may accentuate psychological distress. Outdoor recreational activity is curtailed by ambient pollutants. Limitations and issues in need of further investigation include the following: lack of data on direct experience with climate change rather than indirect assessments related to projected changes; poor spatial resolution in environmental exposures and behavioral assessments; few rigorous quasi-experimental studies; overreliance on self-reports of behavioral outcomes; little consideration of moderator effects; and scant investigation of underlying psychosocial processes to explain projected behavioral impacts.},

  abstract = {Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at ``quasi-baseline'' (December 2004, 0\textendash 6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4\textendash 10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10\textendash 16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2\% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8\%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0\%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8\%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95\% Confidence Interval: 1.1\textendash 1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6\%], OA: 11 [5.2\%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4\textendash 4.7]; p {$<$} 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p {$<$} 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5\textendash 2.9]) in the first 4\textendash 10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5\textendash 5.5) 10\textendash 16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.},

For this problem, the true significance level of the large sample approximate version of the WMW test is known to be sensitive to differences in the shapes of the distributions. Based on a wide ranging simulation study, our paper shows that the problem of lack of robustness of this test is more serious than is thought to be the case. In particular, small differences in variances and moderate degrees of skewness can produce large deviations from the nominal type I error rate. This is further exacerbated when the two distributions have different degrees of skewness. Other rank-based methods like the Fligner\textendash Policello (FP) test and the Brunner\textendash Munzel (BM) test perform similarly, although the BM test is generally better. By considering the WMW test as a two-sample T test on ranks, we explain the results by noting some undesirable properties of the rank transformation. In practice, the ranked samples should be examined and found to sufficiently satisfy reasonable symmetry and variance homogeneity before the test results are interpreted.

A simple model of the incentives to commit crimes is proposed, which explicitly considers possible causes of the persistence of crime over time (criminal inertia). A panel-data based GMM methodology is used to estimate a dynamic model of national crime rates. This estimator controls for unobserved country-specific effects, the joint endogeneity of some of the explanatory variables, and the existence of some types of measurement errors afflicting the crime data. The results show that increases in income inequality raise crime rates, crime tends to be counter-cyclical, and criminal inertia is significant.},

We present new data from a student sample and examples from the psychological literature showing the strength and prevalence of this illusion. We identify some intrinsic cognitive mechanisms (similarity to modus tollens reasoning; verbal ambiguity in describing the meaning of significance tests; and the need to rule out chance findings) and extrinsic social pressures which help to maintain the illusion. We conclude by mentioning some alternative methods for presenting and analyzing psychological data, none of which can be considered the ultimate method.},

  abstract = {Tuvalu, a place whose image in the `West' is as a small island state, insignificant and remote on the world stage, is becoming remarkably prominent in connection with the contemporary issue of climate change-related sea-level rise. My aim in this paper is to advance understanding of the linkages between climate change and island places, by exploring the discursive negotiation of the identity of geographically distant islands and island peoples in the Australian news media. Specifically, I use discourse analytic methods to critically explore how, and to what effects, various representations of the Tuvaluan islands and people in an Australian broadsheet, the Sydney Morning Herald, emphasize difference between Australia and Tuvalu. My hypothesis is that implicating climate change in the identity of people and place can constitute Tuvaluans as .tragic victims. of environmental displacement, marginalizing discourses of adaptation for Tuvaluans and other inhabitants of low-lying islands, and silencing alternative constructions of Tuvaluan identity that could emphasize resilience and resourcefulness. By drawing attention to the problematic ways that island identities are constituted in climate change discourse in the news media, I advocate a more critical approach to the production and consumption of representations of climate change.},

These illnesses are potentially preventable; in Australia high environmental temperatures are common. Aims: To identify (i) possible risk factors for hospital attendance with heat-related illness during a heat wave, (ii) problems with diagnosis and therapy, (iii) issues in prevention, and (iv) areas for further study. Methods: A retrospective descriptive survey from four major teaching hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia (SA), was conducted during a ten day period of exceptional heat in February 1993, in order to review all emergency department presentations (i.e. deaths, casualty treatment or hospital admissions) with a heat-related illness as determined by attending doctors' documentation. Demographic, clinical, management and outcome data were collected. Results: Ninety-four patients were classified as having a heat-related illness of whom 78\% had heat exhaustion. Eighty-five per cent were age 60 years or over; 20\% came from institutional care; 48\% lived alone; 30\% had poor mobility. Peak presentation followed high daily temperatures for four consecutive days. Severity was related to pre-existing cognitive impairment, diuretic use and presenting temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, plasma sodium and plasma creatinine. Treatment tended to be non-standardised. Mortality was 12\%. Seventeen per cent required a more dependent level of residential care upon discharge. Conclusion: Problems were identified in accuracy of diagnosis and appropriate intervention. Awareness of the risk factor profile is needed among health workers, to ensure early preventative strategies. Populations to target for future prevention include elderly people (including those in institutional care), patients with cognitive impairment and patients taking diuretics, multiple medication and/or with other severe co-existing illnesses. Treatment could be more standardised.},

Although both t-tests and WMW tests are usually associated with quite different hypotheses, the decision rule and p-value from either test could be associated with many different sets of assumptions, which we call perspectives. It is useful to have many of the different perspectives to which a decision rule may be applied collected in one place, since each perspective allows a different interpretation of the associated p-value. Here we collect many such perspectives for the two-sample t-test, the WMW test and other related tests. We discuss validity and consistency under each perspective and discuss recommendations between the tests in light of these many different perspectives. Finally, we briefly discuss a decision rule for testing genetic neutrality where knowledge of the many perspectives is vital to the proper interpretation of the decision rule.},

Special attention is devoted to various priming measures and the Implicit Association Test, largely due to their prevalence in the literature. We also attempt to clarify several unresolved theoretical and empirical issues concerning implicit measures, including the nature of the underlying constructs they purport to measure, the conditions under which they are most likely to relate to explicit measures, the kinds of behavior each measure is likely to predict, their sensitivity to context, and the construct's potential for change.},

In Study 1 we asked people to think about their greatest recent regret and to code it as being due to action or inaction. In Study 2 participants described their greatest regret from across their entire life. In both studies we observed an inaction effect only amongst individuals high in self-esteem (HSE). In Study 2 we found that the inaction effect was confined to HSE people whose greatest regret was personal in nature. These results support the claim that regret for inaction is relatively self-enhancing and suggest that the inaction effect found in real-life regrets may be due, in part at least, to the self-enhancement goals of HSE individuals.

Using simulation data, the authors first examine whether there is any empirical evidence for the use of a universal cutoff, and then compare the practice of using the point estimate of the RMSEA alone versus that of using it jointly with its related confidence interval. The results of the study demonstrate that there is little empirical support for the use of .05 or any other value as universal cutoff values to determine adequate model fit, regardless of whether the point estimate is used alone or jointly with the confidence interval. The authors' analyses suggest that to achieve a certain level of power or Type I error rate, the choice of cutoff values depends on model specifications, degrees of freedom, and sample size.},

We investigated this claim by asking participants to write descriptions of strongly regretted events in their own lives and to rate the intensity of the regrets. Participants reported more inaction than action regrets, and, contrary to prior research findings, regrets produced by actions and inactions were equally intense. We conjecture that many factors that affect the content of real-life regrets are eliminated in studies of hypothetical regret. In real life, actions and inactions do not generally produce the same outcomes. Furthermore, actions and inactions may differ in how easily one can anticipate the potential for harm. Specifically, it is plausible that people control their actions to avoid potential regrets, leaving themselves vulnerable to regrets from inactions.},

Objective: To investigate possible relationships between patient and clinical factors and denture wear and use of dentures for eating. Methods: Patients attending Guy's Dental Hospital, London, for provision of complete dentures were recruited. For each patient relevant history was recorded and an examination of the edentulous mouth and existing dentures, where present, was undertaken at the beginning of treatment. At the first post-insertion appointment the edentulous mouth, previous and new dentures were examined. Three months after the review appointment patients were sent a postal questionnaire to assess patient use of dentures and patient satisfaction. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling techniques. Results: 723 patients were recruited. Significant relationships were found between quality of complete dentures and patients' use of complete dentures and between quality of residual edentulous ridges and patients' use of complete dentures. These results contrast with most previous research into prognostic indicators for success in complete denture treatments. Conclusions: Quality of residual edentulous ridges and quality of new complete dentures predict patients' use of new complete dentures.},

  abstract = {The introductory psychology class represents the first opportunity for the field to present new students with a comprehensive overview of psychological research. Writing introductory psychology textbooks is challenging given that authors need to cover many areas they themselves may not be intimately familiar with. This challenge is compounded by problems within the scholarly community in which controversial topics may be communicated in ideological terms within scholarly discourse. Psychological science has historically seen concerns raised about the mismatch between claims and data made about certain fields of knowledge, apprehensions that continue in the present ``replication crisis.'' The concern is that, although acting in good faith, introductory psychology textbook authors may unwittingly communicate information to readers that is factually untrue. Twenty-four leading introductory psychology textbooks were surveyed for their coverage of a number of controversial topics (e.g., media violence, narcissism epidemic, multiple intelligences) and scientific urban legends (e.g., Kitty Genovese, Mozart Effect) for their factual accuracy. Results indicated numerous errors of factual reporting across textbooks, particularly related to failing to inform students of the controversial nature of some research fields and repeating some scientific urban legends as if true. Recommendations are made for improving the accuracy of introductory textbooks.},

Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science's capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous ``undead'' theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.},

The measures collected included: officially recorded convictions (17\textendash 21 years), self-reported ethnicity (21 years), self-reported offending (17\textendash 21 years), family socioeconomic status, leaving school without qualifications, and gender. Young Maori had rates of conviction that were between 4.1\textendash 5.9 times higher than for non-Maori. Much of this association was explained by the fact that Maori also reported higher rates of offending. However, even after statistical control for self-reported offending and individual characteristics (gender, socioeconomic status and educational qualifications) Maori still had rates of conviction that were 1.6\textendash 1.8 times higher than non-Maori These results suggest the presence of a small bias in the arrest/conviction process which leads to Maori offenders having higher rates of conviction than non-Maori offenders with similar offending history and socioeconomic background.},

This study aimed to explore the emotional, physical and practical effects of a young person's self-harm on parents and family. Design and participants We used qualitative methods to explore the emotional, physical and practical effects of a young person's self-harm on their parents and family. We conducted a thematic analysis of thirty-seven semistructured narrative interviews with parents of young people who had self-harmed. Results After the discovery of self-harm, parents described initial feelings of shock, anger and disbelief. Later reactions included stress, anxiety, feelings of guilt and in some cases the onset or worsening of clinical depression. Social isolation was reported, as parents withdrew from social contact due to the perceived stigma associated with self-harm. Parents also described significant impacts on siblings, ranging from upset and stress to feelings of responsibility and worries about stigma at school. Siblings had mixed responses, but were often supportive. Practically speaking, parents found the necessity of being available to their child often conflicted with the demands of full-time work. This, along with costs of, for example, travel and private care, affected family finances. However, parents generally viewed the future as positive and hoped that with help, their child would develop better coping mechanisms. Conclusions Self-harm by young people has major impacts on parents and other family members. Clinicians and staff who work with young people who self-harm should be sensitive to these issues and offer appropriate support and guidance for families.},

The main explanation advanced is that in England and Wales higher temperatures cause people to spend more time outside the home. Time spent outside the home, in line with routine activity explanations for crime, has been shown to increase the risk of criminal victimization for most types of crime. The results suggest that temperature is one of the main factors to be taken into account when explaining quarter-to-quarter and month-to-month variations in recorded crime.},

This book is ideal for use as a primary text for graduate-level psychometrics/measurement courses, as well as for researchers in need of a broad resource for understanding test theory.  Features:   "How it Works" and "Psychometrics in the Real World" boxes break down important concepts through worked examples, and show how theory can be applied to practice.   End-of-chapter exercises allow students to test their comprehension of the material, while suggested readings and website links provide resources for further investigation.   A collection of free online resources include the full output from R, SPSS, and Excel for each of the analyses conducted in the book, as well as additional exercises, sample homework assignments, answer keys, and PowerPoint lecture slides.},

Concurrently, new methods of analysis based on network models are bringing new perspectives on mental (dys)function. This current work analyzed idiographic multivariate time series data using a novel network methodology that incorporates contemporaneous and lagged associations in mood and anxiety symptomatology. Data were taken from 40 individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), or comorbid GAD and MDD, who answered questions about 21 descriptors of mood and anxiety symptomatology 4 times a day over a period of approximately 30 days. The model provided an excellent fit to the intraindividual symptom dynamics of all 40 individuals. The most central symptoms in contemporaneous systems were those related to positive and negative mood. The temporal networks highlighted the importance of anger to symptomatology, while also finding that depressed mood and worry-the principal diagnostic criteria for GAD and MDD-were the least influential nodes across the sample. The method's potential for analysis of individual symptom patterns is demonstrated by 3 exemplar participants. Idiographic network-based analysis may fundamentally alter the way psychopathology is assessed, classified, and treated, allowing researchers and clinicians to better understand individual symptom dynamics.

The explosive development of personal computing and statistical software has facilitated the sophisticated analysis of data, putting capabilities that were once the domain of specialists into the hands of every researcher. The Third Edition of this important text addresses these changes and brings the literature up to date. While the previous edition focused on the use of desktop and handheld calculators, the new edition takes full advantage of modern computing power without losing the elegant simplicity that made the text so popular with students and practitioners alike. In authoritative yet clear terminology, the authors have brought the science of data analysis up to date without compromising its accessibility. Features of the Third Edition include:  New material on sample size calculations and issues in clinical trials, and entirely new chapters on single-sample data, logistic regression, Poisson regression, regression models for matched samples, the analysis of correlated binary data, and methods for analyzing fourfold tables with missing data The addition of many new problems, both numerical and theoretical Answer sections for numerical problems and hints for tackling the theoretical ones A frequentist approach enhanced by the inclusion of empirical Bayesian methodology where appropriate  Combining the latest research with the original studies that established the previous editions as leaders in the field, Statistical Methods for Rates and Proportions, Third Edition will continue to be an invaluable resource for students, statisticians, biostatisticians, and epidemiologists.},

In Study 1, 69 students in dating relationships completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS) and a multidimensional measure of relationship beliefs. In addition, partici-pants completed self-report measures of positive and negative relationship behaviors, and global measures of liking and loving. In Study 2, 91 students in dating relation-ships completed a battery of measures including the MPS and scales assessing perfec-tionism cognitions and perfectionistic self presentation. They also completed mea-sures of dyadic adjustment and limerence (i.e., intense, obsessive low with fears of rejection). Collectively, the findings indicated that individuals with high levels of self-oriented perfectionism and other-oriented perfectionism have stronger relationship beliefs in the areas of communication, trust, and support, suggesting that these perfec-tionists have high relationship standards in these particular areas. Although social prescribed perfectionism had little association with specific relationship beliefs, so-cially prescribed perfectionism was associated with a tendency to display destructive relationship responses (i.e., exit, neglect, and insensitivity), lower dyadic adjustment, and various aspects of limerence, including obsessive preoccupations and emotional dependence on the dating partner. Perfectionistic self-presentation and perfectionism cognitions were also linked with aspects of limerence. The results suggest that inter-personal aspects of perfectionism are associated with self-defeating tendencies in dating relationships.},

Log-linear modelling was performed to investigate the effect of month and relevant demographic variables on the suicide counts. The 16 389 nationally registered suicide deaths during 1980-1989 were analysed. The expected pattern, with a peak in the spring (that is, in September/October) or summer and a trough in winter, was present. This pattern was more pronounced for a sub-group that is less urbanized and for another sub-group with a relatively low standard of living. The secondary peak in autumn was not present for youth or females. In the northern hemisphere, this secondary peak has been ascribed to sociodemographic factors associated with the commencement of the academic year and (for females) bioclimatic factors associated with gender-specific biological circannual rhythms. The fact that the academic year commences in summer in South Africa indicates that the present findings are consistent with the former explanation.},

  abstract = {We provide a basic review of the data screening and assumption testing issues relevant to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis along with practical advice for conducting analyses that are sensitive to these concerns. Historically, factor analysis was developed for explaining the relationships among many continuous test scores, which led to the expression of the common factor model as a multivariate linear regression model with observed, continuous variables serving as dependent variables, and unobserved factors as the independent, explanatory variables. Thus, we begin our paper with a review of the assumptions for the common factor model and data screening issues as they pertain to the factor analysis of continuous observed variables. In particular, we describe how principles from regression diagnostics also apply to factor analysis. Next, because modern applications of factor analysis frequently involve the analysis of the individual items from a single test or questionnaire, an important focus of this paper is the factor analysis of items. Although the traditional linear factor model is well-suited to the analysis of continuously distributed variables, commonly used item types, including Likert-type items, almost always produce dichotomous or ordered categorical variables. We describe how relationships among such items are often not well described by product-moment correlations, which has clear ramifications for the traditional linear factor analysis. An alternative, non-linear factor analysis using polychoric correlations has become more readily available to applied researchers and thus more popular. Consequently, we also review the assumptions and data-screening issues involved in this method. Throughout the paper, we demonstrate these procedures using an historic data set of nine cognitive ability variables.},

A multiple factor hypothesis that operates on three levels is offered as an alternative instrument of causal explanation.

In view of existing data on autistic traits in scientists, we hypothesized that the science students would show higher systemizing than empathizing and that the humanities students would show the opposite pattern. Our findings suggest that individuals in the sciences possess a cognitive style that is more systemizing-driven than empathizing-driven, whereas individuals in humanities possess a cognitive style that is much more empathizing-driven than systemizing-driven. Both type of major and gender independently and highly significantly contribute to this effect. Within the sciences, the systemizing pattern is especially pronounced in engineering and physics. Men and women have been found previously to differ in their systemizing\textendash empathizing cognitive style, with men being stronger in systemizing and women being stronger in empathizing.

  abstract = {Fogelberg DJ, Hoffman JM, Dikmen S, Temkin NR, Bell KR. Association of sleep and co-occurring psychological conditions at 1 year after traumatic brain injury. Objectives To compare individuals' sleep 1 year after traumatic brain injury (TBI) with that of a healthy comparison group, and examine the relationship between sleep, co-occurring conditions, and functional status in those with TBI. Design Longitudinal assessment of a prospectively studied sample of individuals with moderate to severe TBI. Assessment of sleep occurred at 1 year after TBI. Setting Inpatient acute rehabilitation for TBI and community follow-up at 1 year postinjury. Participants Individuals with TBI (N=174) were recruited from consecutive admissions to an inpatient rehabilitation unit and enrolled into the TBI Model Systems study. Participant mean age was 38, and mean Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission was 9.3. Seventy-eight percent of the sample were men. Interventions None. Main Outcome Measures Sleep was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Depression, anxiety, and pain were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, and an analog pain rating scale, respectively. Results Participants with TBI reported significantly greater sleep difficulties than the healthy comparison group. Forty-four percent of participants with TBI reported significant sleep problems (PSQI\&gt;5). Participants with 1 or more co-occurring conditions (depression, pain, or anxiety) had significantly worse sleep than those without such a condition. The highest level of sleep problems was reported by participants with multiple co-occurring conditions. Sleep problems were also associated with poor functional status. Conclusions Sleep difficulties are a frequent problem at 1 year after TBI, and often co-occur with depression, anxiety, and pain. Assessment and treatment of sleep difficulties should be included in clinical practice. Future research on the potential causal relationship among co-occurring conditions may assist in additional intervention planning.},

  abstract = {Network analysis is quickly gaining popularity in psychopathology research as a method that aims to reveal causal relationships among individual symptoms. To date, four main types of psychopathology networks have been proposed: (1) association networks, (2) regularized concentration networks, (3) relative importance networks, and (4) directed acyclic graphs. We examined the replicability of these analyses based on symptoms of major depression and generalized anxiety between and within two highly similar epidemiological samples (i.e., the National Comorbidity Survey \textendash{} Replication [n = 9282] and the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing [n = 8841]). While association networks were stable, the three other types of network analysis (i.e., the conditional independence networks) had poor replicability between and within methods and samples. The detailed aspects of the models\textemdash such as the estimation of specific edges and the centrality of individual nodes\textemdash were particularly unstable. For example, 44\% of the symptoms were estimated as the ``most influential'' on at least one centrality index across the six conditional independence networks in the full samples, and only 13\textendash 21\% of the edges were consistently estimated across these networks. One of the likely reasons for the instability of the networks is the predominance of measurement error in the assessment of individual symptoms. We discuss the implications of these findings for the growing field of psychopathology network research, and conclude that novel results originating from psychopathology networks should be held to higher standards of evidence before they are ready for dissemination or implementation in the field.},

Next, impression-formation judgments were obtained, and subjects' recall and recognition of details of the characters were assessed. Results showed that subjects spent longer learning about mood-consistent details but were faster in making mood-consistent judgments. Overall, happy subjects formed more favorable impressions and made more positive judgments than did sad subjects. Both cued recall and recognition memory were superior for mood-consistent characteristics. Positive mood had a more pronounced effect on judgments and memory than did negative mood. These findings are discussed in terms of recent theories of mood effects on cognition, and the likely implications of the results for everyday person-perception judgments are considered.},

Central to good qualitative research is whether the research participants' subjective meanings, actions and social contexts, as understood by them, are illuminated. This paper aims to provide beginning researchers, and those unfamiliar with qualitative research, with an orientation to the principles that inform the evaluation of the design, conduct, findings and interpretation of qualitative research. It orients the reader to two philosophical perspectives, the interpretive and critical research paradigms, which underpin both the qualitative research methodologies most often used in mental health research, and how qualitative research is evaluated. Criteria for evaluating quality are interconnected with standards for ethics in qualitative research. They include principles for good practice in the conduct of qualitative research, and for trustworthiness in the interpretation of qualitative data. The paper reviews these criteria, and discusses how they may be used to evaluate qualitative research presented in research reports. These principles also offer some guidance about the conduct of sound qualitative research for the beginner qualitative researcher.},

  abstract = {Background In July 2006, a lasting and severe heat wave occurred in Western Europe. Since the 2003 heat wave, several preventive measures and an alert system aiming at reducing the risks related to high temperatures have been set up in France by the health authorities and institutions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of those measures, the observed excess mortality during the 2006 heat wave was compared to the expected excess mortality. Methods A Poisson regression model relating the daily fluctuations in summer temperature and mortality in France from 1975 to 2003 was used to estimate the daily expected number of deaths over the period 2004-2006 as a function of the observed temperatures. Results During the 2006 heat wave (from 11 to 28 July), about 2065 excess deaths occurred in France. Considering the observed temperatures and with the hypothesis that heat-related mortality had not changed since 2003, 6452 excess deaths were predicted for the period. The observed mortality during the 2006 heat wave was thus markedly less than the expected mortality ([\textasciitilde ]4400 less deaths). Conclusions The excess mortality during the 2006 heat wave, which was markedly lower than that predicted by the model, may be interpreted as a decrease in the population's vulnerability to heat, together with, since 2003, increased awareness of the risk related to extreme temperatures, preventive measures and the set-up of the warning system.},

In every topic John Fox deals with--and he does not avoid the slippery ones--he shows a clarity and depth of understanding that goes beyond anything else I have seen in textbooks and that matches the works of the leading researchers within each field."  --Georges Monette, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University  "The selection of examples throughout the book is one of its strengths, as they are generally quite engaging in ''real-world'' interest, and demonstrate the practical use (and limitations) of the statistical methods far better than contrived data. I appreciate the fact that John Fox describes what each example ''means'' in terms of the substantive problem behind the data--students would find this quite useful."  --Michael Friendly, Psychology Department, York University  Aimed at researchers and students who want to use linear models for data analysis, John Fox's book provides an accessible, in-depth treatment of regression analysis, linear models, and closely related methods. Fox incorporates nearly 200 graphs and numerous examples and exercises that employ real data from the social sciences. He begins the book with a concise consideration of the role of statistical data analysis in social research. He next covers graphical methods for examining and transforming data, linear least-squares regression, dummy-variables regression, and analysis of variance. Fox also explores diagnostic methods for discovering whether a linear model fit to data adequately represents the data; extensions to linear least squares, including logit and probit models, time-series regression, nonlinear regression, robust regression, and nonparametric regression; and empirical methods for assessing sampling variation, including the bootstrap and cross-validation. More difficult material is segregated in separate sections and chapters and several appendixes are also included presenting background information. Scholars, professionals, researchers, and students in research methods, evaluation, education, sociology, and psychology will appreciate the enhanced and thorough treatment that regression analysis, linear models, and other related methods have received by author John Fox.},

"Disasters - both natural and man-made - only exist                     when covered by the media. Plenty of terrible things happen that remain                     unreported. Most disasters are known about only by those directly affected. And                     the crises that do get media attention are not necessarily those that kill and                     otherwise harm the most victims. There is invariably a random element in how                     much, or if at all, something is reported, but this is even more so in faraway,                     difficult locations." As a result, she claims, aid agencies are having to employ                     questionable methods to obtain media attention. "Today many aid campaigns are                     substantial global operations and it is in the public interest that they are                     reported rigorously and impartially. If journalists and aid workers embrace each                     other too tightly, that's unlikely to happen."},

A factor analysis generally supported the classification of fears and phobias into: (1) situational phobias (lightning, enclosed spaces, darkness, flying and heights); (2) animal phobias (spiders and snakes); and (3) mutilation phobias (injections, dentists, injuries). Total point prevalence of any specific phobia was 19.9\% (26.5\% for females and 12.4\% for males). In total, 21.2\% women and 10.9\% men met criterias for any single specific phobia. Multiple phobias was reported by 5.4\% of the females and 1.5\% of the males. Animal phobia had a prevalence of 12.1\% in women and 3.3\% in men. Point prevalence of situational phobia was 17.4\% in women and 8.5\% in men. For mutilation phobia no gender difference was observed, being presented in 3.2\% of the women and 2.7\% of the men. Women as compared to men gave higher fear ratings for all objects and situations. Inanimate object fears and phobias were more common in older than younger individuals. Animal fears were more intense in younger than in older individuals. Fear of flying increased and fear of injections decreased as a function of age in women but not in men. Thus, specific fears and phobias are heterogeneous with respect to sex and age distribution.},

Regression estimates are generally biased, but the bias is small with large samples.

Asymptotic expansions make these ideas more precise.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This article reviews the literature from the past 40 years of research related to monosodium glutamate (MSG) and its ability to trigger a migraine headache, induce an asthma exacerbation, or evoke a constellation of symptoms described as the ``Chinese restaurant syndrome.''Data sources: Literature retrieved by a search using PubMed, Medline, Lexis-Nexus, and Infotrac to review articles from the past 40 years.Conclusions: MSG has a widespread reputation for eliciting a variety of symptoms, ranging from headache to dry mouth to flushing. Since the first report of the so-called Chinese restaurant syndrome 40 years ago, clinical trials have failed to identify a consistent relationship between the consumption of MSG and the constellation of symptoms that comprise the syndrome. Furthermore, MSG has been described as a trigger for asthma and migraine headache exacerbations, but there are no consistent data to support this relationship. Although there have been reports of an MSG-sensitive subset of the population, this has not been demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials.Implications for practice: Despite a widespread belief that MSG can elicit a headache, among other symptoms, there are no consistent clinical data to support this claim. Findings from the literature indicate that there is no consistent evidence to suggest that individuals may be uniquely sensitive to MSG. Nurse practitioners should therefore concentrate their efforts on advising patients of the nutritional pitfalls of some Chinese restaurant meals and to seek more consistently documented etiologies for symptoms such as headache, xerostomia, or flushing.},

This interpretation supports the statistical needs of experimental scientists and pollsters; probabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process (and are thus ideally devoid of opinion). It does not support all needs; gamblers typically require estimates of the odds without experiments. The development of the frequentist account was motivated by the problems and paradoxes of the previously dominant viewpoint, the classical interpretation. In the classical interpretation, probability was defined in terms of the principle of indifference, based on the natural symmetry of a problem, so, e.g. the probabilities of dice games arise from the natural symmetric 6-sidedness of the cube. This classical interpretation stumbled at any statistical problem that has no natural symmetry for reasoning.},

In particular, Communicating Uncertainty examines how well the mass media convey to the public the complexities, ambiguities, and controversies that are part of scientific uncertainty.   In addition to its new approach to scientific uncertainty and mass media interactions, this book distinguishes itself in the quality of work it assembles by some of the best known science communication scholars in the world. This volume continues the exploration of interactions between scientists and journalists that the three coeditors first documented in their highly successful volume, Scientists and Journalists: Reporting Science as News, which was used for many years as a text in science journalism courses around the world.},

A model is developed to account for these variations in test strategies, beginning with the premise that cognitive processes are adapted to reducing particularly costly errors rather than to detecting "truth" (Cosmides \& Tooby, 1992). By specifying the information required to minimize various errors of primary concern, the model clarifies the adaptiveness of certain confirmatory preferences, identifies conditions under which such preferences should diminish, and outlines how error minimization goals might produce data preferences coincidentally consistent with normative prescriptions.},

Here we conceptualize depression as a complex dynamic system of interacting symptoms to examine what symptoms are most central to driving depressive processes. We constructed a network of 28 depression symptoms assessed via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-30) in 3,463 depressed outpatients from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. We estimated the centrality of all IDS-30 symptoms, and compared the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms; centrality reflects the connectedness of each symptom with all other symptoms. A network with 28 intertwined symptoms emerged, and symptoms differed substantially in their centrality values. Both DSM symptoms (e.g., sad mood) and non-DSM symptoms (e.g., anxiety) were among the most central symptoms, and DSM criteria were not more central than non-DSM symptoms. Many subjects enrolled in STAR*D reported comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions which may have affected symptom presentation. The network perspective neither supports the standard psychometric notion that depression symptoms are equivalent indicators of MD, nor the common assumption that DSM symptoms of depression are of higher clinical relevance than non-DSM depression symptoms. The findings suggest the value of research focusing on especially central symptoms to increase the accuracy of predicting outcomes such as the course of illness, probability of relapse, and treatment response.},

Reminding participants of the adverse consequences climate change may have for their country increased the derogation of societal groups that may threaten the collective (e.g., criminals) as well as general authoritarian attitudes. Salient climate change threats also led to system justification and approval of system supporting groups (e.g., judges) in those people who were highly identified with their nation. We discuss the implications of these findings for the explanation of authoritarian attitudes and the question of how societies may cope with the subtle social psychological effects of climate change.},

Yet there is no precise definition of, and there is a paucity of research on, this construct. Based on what has been theorized about perfectionism, a multidimensional measure was developed and several hypotheses regarding the nature of perfectionism were tested in four separate studies. The major dimension of this measure was excessive concern over making mistakes. Five other dimensions were identified, including high personal standards, the perception of high parental expectations, the perception of high parental criticism, the doubting of the quality of one's actions, and a preference for order and organization. Perfectionism and certain of its subscales were correlated with a wide variety of psychopathological symptoms. There was also an association between perfectionism and procrastination. Several subscales of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), personal standards and organization, were associated with positive achievement striving and work habits. The MPS was highly correlated with one of the existing measures of perfectionism. Two other existing measures were only moderately correlated with the MPS and with each other. Future studies of perfectionism should take into account the multidimensional nature of the construct.},

  abstract = {This longitudinal study aimed to investigate changes in self-efficacy, resilience, and connectedness to school in students participating in Project K, a positive youth development programme. Eighty secondary school students were recruited from five schools across New Zealand. These formed two groups: a Project K group made up of 49 students, and a comparison group made up of 31 students. Over fourteen months, six waves of measurement were completed by Project K participants and four waves of measurement were completed by a comparison group. Self-efficacy was measured using the Project K Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, while resilience was measured using the Resilience Scale, and connectedness to school was measured using the Hemingway Adolescent Connectedness Scale. Preliminary analysis confirmed variance in individual and group data indicating more complex multilevel analysis would be beneficial in investigating changes in self-efficacy, resilience, and connectedness to school. As expected, the Project K group began with lower self-efficacy than the comparison group. However, after controlling for differences in initial status, Project K participants improved at a faster rate over the course of the programme than the control group. Gender difference in initial self-efficacy scores were noted, with females having higher self-efficacy than males, however these initial differences were unrelated to rates of change over time. Project K participants had lower resilience at the start of the study but after controlling for the initial group differences, the Project K group was found to improve at a faster rate when compared to the comparison group. There was no difference between groups at the start of the programme, or in rate of change over time in the connectedness to school variable, and no relationship between gender and changes in resilience or connectedness to school scores over time. To conclude, implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

For steady exposure to cold and warm environments, thermal comfort and neutral temperature sensations lie in the range for physiological thermal neutrality (28\textdegree -30\textdegree C), in which there is no physiological temperature regulatory effort. Discomfort increases more rapidly below 28\textdegree C than above 30\textdegree C, while thermal sensation for both heat and cold increases rapidly each side of neutral. Discomfort correlates best with lowering average skin temperature toward cold environments and with increased sweating toward hot environments. In general, discomfort is associated with a change of average body temperature from 36.5\textdegree C. The same conclusion follows for transient changes when the subject goes from comfortable to uncomfortable, neutral to cold, and neutral to warm. When these transients are reversed (i.e., cold to neutral, hot to neutral), the sensations of comfort and temperature "lead" the body temperature changes and are thus "anticipatory." This hysteresis effect is most striking in the cold and less so for warmth. For transients from cold to warm, the rate of rise of skin temperature causes a sensation that compensates for and predominates over the sensation of discomfort caused by a low skin temperature itself. Finally, thermal discomfort is an excellent stimulus for behavioral activity by man. As a sensation, it gives man both an early and anticipatory drive for conscious action that may effect changes in his body's microclimate rather than having him depend on natural but short-term means of thermal protection--sweating, vasodilation, vasoconstriction and shivering.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Introduction: To investigate relationships between ambient temperatures and violent crimes to determine whether those relationships are consistent across different crime categories and whether they are best described as increasing linear functions, or as curvilinear functions that decrease beyond some temperature threshold. A secondary objective was to consider the implications of the observed relationships for injuries and deaths from violent crimes in the context of a warming climate. To address these questions, we examined the relationship between daily ambient temperatures and daily incidents of violent crime in Dallas, Texas from 1993\textendash 1999. Methods: We analyzed the relationships between daily fluctuations in ambient temperature, other meteorological and temporal variables, and rates of daily violent crime using time series piece-wise regression and plots of daily data. Violent crimes, including aggravated assault, homicide, and sexualassault, were analyzed. Results: We found that daily mean ambient temperature is related in a curvilinear fashion to daily rates of violent crime with a positive and increasing relationship between temperature and aggravated crime that moderates beyond temperatures of 80 F and then turns negative beyond 90 F. Conclusion: While some have characterized the relationship between temperature and violent crime as a continually increasing linear function, leaving open the possibility that aggravated crime will increase in a warmer climate, we conclude that the relationship in Dallas is not linear, but moderatesand turns negative at high ambient temperatures. We posit that higher temperatures may encourage people to seek shelter in cooler indoor spaces, and that street crime and other crimes of opportunity are subsequently decreased. This finding suggests that the higher ambient temperatures expected with climate change may result in marginal shifts in violent crime in the short term, but are not likely to be accompanied by markedly higher rates of violent crime and associated increased incidence of injuryand death. Additional studies are indicated, across cities at varying latitudes that experience a range of daily ambient temperatures. [West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(3):239\textendash 246.]},

The purpose of this research was to validate a Portuguese-language version of the scale, using a sample of 409 students, by attempting to re produce its factor structure. The reliability analysis revealed acceptable internal consistency indexes in all subscales. Construct validity was assessed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The contributions of the factors and index of goodness-of-fit demonstrated the need to eliminate two items, which seems to agree with the results in other validation studies. Overall, results revealed that the SIMS is composed of four con sistent factors and attested its psychometric quality. The scale does seem to represent a self-report measure of situational intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, external regulation, and amotivation, and can be widely used for the assessment of this construct in Portuguese academic contexts.Key words: Self-determination; situational moti vation; motivation measures; high school students; undergraduate students},

  abstract = {Background Nurse turnover in the residential aged care industry is a pressing issue. Researchers have shown ongoing interest in exploring how the factors that are amendable to change in aged care policy, regulation and funding and in organizational procedures (e.g. job demands, coping resources and psychological health of nurses) impact on turnover. However, the findings are mixed. Objective This study tested two theoretical models of turnover to examine the structural relationships among job demands, coping resources, psychological health and turnover of residential aged care nurses. Although many previous studies operationalized turnover as intention to leave, the present study investigated actual turnover by following up with the same individuals over time, and thus provided more accurate predictive models of turnover behaviour. Design and methods The sample, 239 Australian residential aged care nurses, came from the Nurses and Midwives e-cohort Study. Job demands, coping resources, and psychological health were measured using standardized instruments. Structural equation modelling was used to test the measurement and structural models. Results Controlling for a number of workforce and individual characteristics, coping resources (measured by job control, supervisor support, and co-worker support) were negatively and directly associated with turnover. Additionally, the findings supported the Job Demand-Control-Support model in that higher coping resources and lower job demands (indicated by psychological demands, physical demands, and effort) were related to better psychological health (measured by vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health), and higher job demands were related to lower coping resources. Conclusions Findings suggest that aged care policy makers and service providers might consider increasing coping resources available to nurses and minimizing job demands of care work to reduce turnover and improve nurses' psychological health. Moreover, findings from this Australian study may provide valuable practical and policy implications for other developed countries.},

This article addresses this debate from the perspective of scientific inquiry and inference. Inference is an inverse problem and application of statistical methods cannot reveal whether effects exist or whether they are empirically meaningful. Hence, raising conclusions from the outcomes of statistical analyses is subject to limitations. NHST has been criticized for its misuse and the misconstruction of its outcomes, also stressing its inability to meet expectations that it was never designed to fulfil. Ironically, alternatives to NHST are identical in these respects, something that has been overlooked in their presentation. Three of those alternatives are discussed here (estimation via confidence intervals and effect sizes, quantification of evidence via Bayes factors, and mere reporting of descriptive statistics). None of them offers a solution to the problems that NHST is purported to have, all of them are susceptible to misuse and misinterpretation, and some bring around their own problems (e.g., Bayes factors have a one-to-one correspondence with p values, but they are entirely deprived of an inferential framework). Those alternatives also fail to cover a broad area of inference not involving distributional parameters, where NHST procedures remain the only (and suitable) option. Like knives or axes, NHST is not inherently evil; only misuse and misinterpretation of its outcomes needs to be eradicated.},

This model can be modified in 2 ways to accommodate this problem. In the overdispersed model, a factor can be estimated that corrects the regression model's inferential statistics.

Having grown up witnessing   at close range the destructive effects of political patronage on powerless, disenfranchised   Chicago communities, Gecan knows from experience that strong relationships in the   public sphere and sustained and disciplined organizing can spark the public and private   alchemy necessary to achieve sidewalks, parks, schools, housing--and the collective   renewal that results.  Full of good advice and entertaining accounts of success,   Going Public is the story of those who, says Gecan, ``succeed in unexpected ways and   in unexpected places.''},

Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary\textemdash for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1\% significance level to 4.9\%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems\textemdash that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not significant'' is not itself statistically significant.},

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean {$\pm$}1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option\textemdash an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file\textemdash so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

  abstract = {Depressive illness and related suicide attempts have been reported to have seasonal variation, possibly related to weather. This study sought to determine the effects of weather and time of year on suicide attempts by carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Cases of patients in western Washington State attempting suicide by CO poisoning and referred to a regional hyperbaric oxygen treatment center from 1981-1995 were reviewed retrospectively. Information from the National Climatic Data Center was used to compare date of treatment to local weather data on the day of attempted suicide and on each day of the preceding week. The study population consisted of 264 patients attempting suicide by CO poisoning on 251 days of the 15-yr period. Mean and total precipitation in the preceding 7 days strongly correlated with attempted suicide rate, with incident rate ratios ranging from 1.75 to 2.77 and 1.14 to 1.75, respectively (P values {$<$}0.05). A decrease in minimum daily temperature also correlated with attempted suicide rate. No other weather variables showed significant correlation with dates of CO suicide attempts. February, March, and October were seen to be separate factors related to a higher incidence of attempted suicide by CO poisoning. Precipitation in Seattle, change in minimum temperature, and month of the year correlated with the regional incidence of suicide attempts with CO poisoning.},

In this article, the quality of the three-item scale for emotional loneliness and the three-item scale for social loneliness has been investigated for use in the following countries participating in the United Nations ``Generations and Gender Surveys'': France, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Japan. Sample sizes for the 7 countries varied between 8,158 and 12,828. Translations of the De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale have been tested using reliability and validity tests including a confirmatory factor analysis to test the two-dimensional structure of loneliness. Test outcomes indicated for each of the countries under investigation reliable and valid scales for emotional and social loneliness, respectively.},

Why is that? Structural barriers such as a climate-averse infrastructure are part of the answer, but psychological barriers also impede behavioral choices that would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental sustainability. Although many individuals are engaged in some ameliorative action, most could do more, but they are hindered by seven categories of psychological barriers, or ``dragons of inaction'': limited cognition about the problem, ideological worldviews that tend to preclude pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, comparisons with key other people, sunk costs and behavioral momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and positive but inadequate behavior change. Structural barriers must be removed wherever possible, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. Psychologists must work with other scientists, technical experts, and policymakers to help citizens overcome these psychological barriers.

In the social sciences, statistical methods fundamentally changed research practice, making statistical inference its centerpiece. At the same time, textbook writers in the social sciences have transformed rivaling statistical systems into an apparently monolithic method that could be used mechanically. The idol of a universal method for scientific inference has been worshipped since the ``inference revolution'' of the 1950s. Because no such method has ever been found, surrogates have been created, most notably the quest for significant p values. This form of surrogate science fosters delusions and borderline cheating and has done much harm, creating, for one, a flood of irreproducible results. Proponents of the ``Bayesian revolution'' should be wary of chasing yet another chimera: an apparently universal inference procedure. A better path would be to promote both an understanding of the various devices in the ``statistical toolbox'' and informed judgment to select among these.},

Criticisms focus on the construction and interpretation of a procedure that has dominated the reporting of empirical results for over fifty years. There is evidence that null hypothesis significance testing as practiced in political science is deeply flawed and widely misunderstood. This is important since most empirical work argues the value of findings through the use of the null hypothesis significance test. In this article I review the history of the null hypothesis significance testing paradigm in the social sciences and discuss major problems, some of which are logical inconsistencies while others are more interpretive in nature. I suggest alter native techniques to convey effectively the importance of data-analytic findings. These recommendations are illustrated with examples using empirical political science publications.},

But is this tendency universal across cultures, or is it the product of the West's obsession with action and self-actualization? To address this question, the authors conducted five studies in three cultures thought to be less individualistic than the United States-China, Japan, and Russia. Respondents in all three cultures tended to regret-like their counterparts in the United States-inactions more than actions in the long term. Nor did the types of regrets reported by participants in these cultures-overwhelmingly involving the self exclusively rather than the social group-differ from the regrets reported by U.S. samples. These data support the universality of the tendency for inaction to generate greater long-term regret than action.},

The objectives of this study were to highlight key differences between interrater agreement and interrater reliability; describe the key concepts and approaches to evaluating interrater agreement and interrater reliability; and provide examples of their applications to research in the field of social and administrative pharmacy. This is a descriptive review of interrater agreement and interrater reliability indices. It outlines the practical applications and interpretation of these indices in social and administrative pharmacy research. Interrater agreement indices assess the extent to which the responses of 2 or more independent raters are concordant. Interrater reliability indices assess the extent to which raters consistently distinguish between different responses. A number of indices exist, and some common examples include Kappa, the Kendall coefficient of concordance, Bland-Altman plots, and the intraclass correlation coefficient. Guidance on the selection of an appropriate index is provided. In conclusion, selection of an appropriate index to evaluate interrater agreement or interrater reliability is dependent on a number of factors including the context in which the study is being undertaken, the type of variable under consideration, and the number of raters making assessments.},

The possibility that climate change would create more violent conflict was mentioned in scattered places in the Third and Fourth Assessment Reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 2001 and 2007 respectively. The empirical literature testing for relationships between climate change and various forms of conflict has undergone a major expansion since then. The report from Working Group II of the Fifth Assessment Report contains a much more careful assessment of the climate change-conflict nexus. The Human security chapter reports high agreement and robust evidence that human security will be progressively threatened as the climate changes. But as far as the impact on armed conflict is concerned, it paints a balanced picture, concluding that while individual studies vary in their conclusions, `collectively the research does not conclude that there is a strong positive relationship between warming and armed conflict'. The chapter also argues that climate change is likely to have an influence on some known drivers of conflict, and this point is reiterated in other chapters as well as the Technical summary and the Summary for policymakers. A chapter on `Emergent trends \ldots ' has a somewhat more dramatic conclusion regarding a climate-conflict link, as does the Africa chapter, while a methods chapter on `Detection and attribution' dismisses the climate-change-to-violence link. The entire report is suffused with terms like `may', `has the potential to', and other formulations without any indication of a level of probability. Overall, the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC does not support the view that climate change is an important threat to the long-term waning of war. Still, the report opens up for conflicting interpretations and overly alarmist media translations.},

Subjects read about individuals who experienced gains or losses as a result of either deciding to take action and make a change or deciding not to take any new action. In addition, the salience of the counterfactual alternative was manipulated. Past results were replicated in the case of negative outcomes: Individuals who lost money on the basis of action were judged as feeling worse than those who lost money on the basis of inaction. This occurred under both high and low salience of the counterfactual. With positive consequences, however, exaggerated affect for outcomes associated with action rather than inaction occurred only when the counterfactual alternative was made highly salient. Implications for the construction and use of counterfactuals are discussed, and a process model is developed on the basis of the data and the proposed conceptualization.},

  abstract = {One of the most important decisions that can be made in the use of factor analysis is the number of factors to retain. Numerous studies have consistently shown that Horn's parallel analysis is the most nearly accurate methodology for determining the number of factors to retain in an exploratory factor analysis. Although Horn's procedure is relatively accurate, it still tends to error in the direction of indicating the retention of one or two more factors than is actually warranted or of retaining poorly defined factors. A modification of Horn's parallel analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation of the null distributions of the eigenvalues generated from a population correlation identity matrix is introduced. This modification allows identification of any desired upper 1 - a percentile, such as the 95th percentile of this set of distributions. The 1 - ax percentile then can be used to determine whether an eigenvalue is larger than what could be expected by chance. Horn based his original procedure on the average eigenvalues derived from this set of distributions. The modified procedure reduces the tendency of the parallel analysis methodology to overextract. An example is provided that demonstrates this capability. A demonstration is also given that indicates that the parallel analysis procedure and its modification are insensitive to the distributional characteristics of the data used to generate the eigenvalue distributions.},

We posit that anti-vaccination beliefs are an outcome of a general psychological propensity to believe in conspiracies based on new research on the interconnectedness of conspiracy beliefs. These ideas are tested with a confirmatory factor analysis and a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model of a nationally representative U.S. sample from the 2016 American National Election Studies. The confirmatory factor analysis shows that anti-vaccination beliefs highly correlate with belief in the unrelated conspiracies that Obama is a Muslim and 9/11 trutherism. Our SUR models also show that all three of these very different beliefs have similar predictors. All three have a negative correlation with political trust, political knowledge, education, and a positive correlation with authoritarianism. Thus, anti-vaccination beliefs are shown to be part of a psychological propensity to believe in conspiracies.},

  abstract = {Photoperiodism is a process whereby organisms are able to use both absolute measures of day length and the direction of day length change as a basis for regulating seasonal changes in physiology and behavior. The use of day length cues allows organisms to essentially track time-of-year and to ``anticipate'' relatively predictable annual variations in important environmental parameters. Thus, adaptive types of seasonal biological changes can be molded through evolution to fit annual environmental cycles. Studies of the formal properties of photoperiodic mechanisms have revealed that most organisms use circadian oscillators to measure day length. Two types of paradigms, designated as the external and internal coincidence models, have been proposed to account for photoperiodic time measurement by a circadian mechanism. Both models postulate that the timing of light exposure, rather than the total amount of light, is critical to the organism's perception of day length. In mammals, a circadian oscillator(s) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus receives photic stimuli via the retinohypothalamic tract. The circadian system regulates the rhythmic secretion of the pineal hormone, melatonin. Melatonin is secreted at night, and the duration of secretion varies in inverse relation to day length; thus, photoperiod information is ``encoded'' in the melatonin signal. The melatonin signal is presumably ``decoded'' in melatonin target tissues that are involved in the regulation of a variety of seasonal responses. Variations in photoperiodic response are seen not only between species but also between breeding populations within a species and between individuals within single breeding populations. Sometimes these variations appear to be the result of differences in responsiveness to melatonin; in other cases, variations in photoperiod responsiveness may depend on differences in patterns of melatonin secretion related to circadian variation. Sites of action for melatonin in mammals are not yet well characterized, but potential targets of particular interest include the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland and the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Both these sites exhibit uptake of radiolabeled melatonin in various species, and there is some evidence for direct action of melatonin at these sites. However, it appears that there are species differences with respect to the importance and specific functions of various melatonin target sites.},

This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

Simply put, it is" faster today to compute an exact p-value than to look up an approximation in a table of the not-quite-appropriate statistic. As a result, more and more researchers are using Permutation Tests to analyze their data.

  abstract = {In the last decade, the number of investigations of the beliefs in conspiracy theories has begun to increase in the fields of social, differential, and experimental psychology. A considerable number of variables have been suggested as predictors of conspiracy beliefs, amongst them personality factors such as low agreeableness (as disagreeableness is associated with suspicion and antagonism) and high openness to experience (due to its positive association to seek out unusual and novel ideas). The association between agreeableness, openness to experience and conspiracy beliefs remains unclear in the literature. The present study reviews the literature of psychological studies investigating conspiracy beliefs. Additionally, the association between Big Five personality factors and conspiracy beliefs is analyzed meta-analytically using random-effects models. Ninety-six studies were identified for the systematic review. A comprehensive account of predictors, consequences, operationalization, questionnaires, and most prominent conspiracy theories is presented. For meta-analysis, 74 effect sizes from 13 studies were extracted. The psychological literature on predictors of conspiracy beliefs can be divided in approaches either with a pathological (e.g., paranoia) or socio-political focus (e.g., perceived powerlessness). Generally, there is a lack of theoretical frameworks in this young area of research. Meta-analysis revealed that agreeableness, openness to experience, and the remaining Big Five personality factors were not significantly associated with conspiracy beliefs if effect sizes are aggregated. Considerable heterogeneity in designs and operationalization characterizes the field. This article provides an overview of instrumentation, study designs, and current state of knowledge in an effort towards advancement and consensus in the study of conspiracy beliefs.},

A major result, expected for the small-scale data of this problem, is that average crime count by precinct is the major determinant of forecast accuracy. A fixed-effects regression model of absolute percent forecast error shows that such counts need to be on the order of 30 or more to achieve accuracy of 20\% absolute forecast error or less. A second major result is that practically any model-based forecasting approach is vastly more accurate than current police practices. Holt exponential smoothing with monthly seasonality estimated using city-wide data is the most accurate forecast model for precinct-level crime series.},

Although much of this scholarship lends support to the perspective, important issues have been raised as the perspective is extended, modified, and refined; among these are that the theory places too much emphasis on compulsion and too little on choice in the causation of crime, that it neglects the role of morality in decisions about crime, and that the theory needs to be reconciled with results of research about criminal deterrence. This paper considers each of these issues. A framework is presented to describe essential elements of all control theories and finds no inconsistency between some types of control theory and evidence about situational effects, evidence of moral elements of decision-making, and the lack of severity effects in the deterrence literature for the criminal law.},

However, little systematic research on clusters of attempted suicides exists. The present study examines the extent and nature of clustering of suicide attempts. Method The occurrence of clustering of attempted suicide was examined in nationwide data for all New Zealand hospitals, obtained from the New Zealand Health Statistics Services for the years 1988\textendash 1990. The Scan statistic and Knox procedure were employed for testing the significance of clusters in time and time-space, respectively. Results The analyses indicated that significant time clustering occurred in younger age groups, specifically among 15\textendash 19 and 20\textendash 24 year olds. The results could not be accounted for by seasonal variations in admissions. Age specificity of time-space clusters emerged, exhibiting a similar pattern to that reported for completed suicides in the US. Conclusions The results suggest a similar underlying mechanism for the clustering of parasuicide and completed suicides and provide support for the existence of contagion of suicidal behaviour. The implications for prevention are discussed.},

Our new empirical approach shows that country-specific suicide levels can be explained by particular living conditions that cannot be regarded as social phenomena (such as climatic conditions). In contrast, deviations from suicide levels over time are determined by social circumstances referring to Anomie.},

Although multiple regression is commonly used in such cases to test the individual effects of many explanatory variables on a continuous response, the inherent collinearity (multicollinearity) of confounded explanatory variables encumbers analyses and threatens their statistical and inferential interpretation. Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multicollinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r {$\geq$} 0.28 or r2 {$\geq$} 0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation. Then, using real ecological data, I demonstrated the utility of various statistical techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretation of ecological multiple regression in the presence of multicollinearity.},

To illustrate this problem, we assessed whether the methods of reviews involved in two recent controversies met the common scientific standard of being reported in sufficient detail to be repeated by an independent researcher. We found that none of the reviews were repeatable by this standard. Later stages of the review process, such as quantitative analyses, were generally described well, but the more fundamental, data-gathering stage was not fully described in any of the reviews. To address the irreproducibility of review conclusions, we believe that ecologists and conservation biologists should recognize that literature searches for reviews are a data gathering exercise and apply the same rigorous study design principles and reporting standards that they would use for primary studies.},

  abstract = {Inhibition in task switching is inferred from n-2 repetition costs: the observation that ABA task switching sequences are responded to slower than CBA sequences. This is thought to reflect the persisting inhibition of task A, which slows re-activation attempts. Mayr (2002) reported an experiment testing a critical non-inhibitory account of this effect, namely episodic retrieval: If the trial parameters for task A match across an ABA sequence, responses should be facilitated due to priming from episodic retrieval; a cost would occur if trial parameters mismatch. In a rule-switching paradigm, Mayr reported no significant difference in n-2 repetition cost when the trial parameters repeated or switched across an ABA sequence, in clear contrast to the episodic retrieval account. What remains unclear is whether successful episodic retrieval modulates the n-2 repetition cost. Across three experiments \textemdash{} including a close replication of Mayr (2002) \textemdash{} we find clear evidence of reduced n-2 task repetition costs when episodic retrieval is controlled. We find that the effect of episodic retrieval on the n-2 task repetition cost is increased when the cue\textendash task relationship is made more abstract, suggesting the effect is due to interference in establishing the relevant attentional set. We also demonstrate that the episodic retrieval effect is not influenced by retrieval of low-level, perceptual, elements. Together, the data suggest the n-2 task repetition cost \textemdash{} typically attributable to an inhibitory mechanism \textemdash{} is largely explained by episodic retrieval effects.},

In Study 2, the objective initiative taken by call center employees was most positively related to the revenue that they generated in subsequent months when they reported high autonomous motivation and low controlled motivation.

Three factors were crossed to yield 81 subcases: the number of underlying dimen sions (0, 1, or 2), the number of items (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50), and the number of subjects (100, 250, or 500). The mean eigenvalues for the sub cases were evaluated using parallel analysis and the scree technique. The mean eigenvectors were visually inspected. For almost all subcases with one or two un derlying dimensions, a single spurious factor was able to be identified using parallel analysis. However, in comparison with the nonspurious factors, it was small in magnitude and, in practice, factors of this relative size might be interpreted as trivial. It was concluded that researchers may have some confidence in inter preting linear factor analysis with binary items if they are using a test instrument that has been carefully de veloped.},

However, null P values still thrive in most journals and are routinely misinterpreted as probabilities of a "chance finding" or of the null, when they are no such thing. This misuse may be lessened by recognizing correct Bayesian interpretations. For example, under weak priors, 95\% confidence intervals approximate 95\% posterior probability intervals, one-sided P values approximate directional posterior probabilities, and point estimates approximate posterior medians. Furthermore, under certain conditions, a one-sided P value for a prior median provides an approximate lower bound on the posterior probability that the point estimate is on the wrong side of that median. More generally, P values can be incorporated into a modern analysis framework that emphasizes measurement of fit, distance, and posterior probability in place of "statistical significance" and accept/reject decisions.},

This basis is important, because the use of realistic priors in a statistical analysis can yield more stringent tests of hypotheses and more accurate estimates than conventional procedures.},

Despite the fact that Freud never empirically established that these implications hold, the 'tally argument' does draw attention to a critical distinction that is too often neglected in contemporary empirical studies of psychoanalysis and other forms of psychotherapy: between empirical evaluations of the efficacy of psychotherapy and empirical evaluations of theoretical explanations of the efficacy of psychotherapy, and the different forms of comparative enquiry relevant to each. It is argued that the contemporary neglect of this critical distinction, in conjunction with the common negative conception of placebo control treatments in psychotherapy research, has led to the epistemic impoverishment of experimental studies of the various professional psychotherapies. In consequence, although there is good empirical evidence for the efficacy of psychoanalysis and other forms of professional psychotherapy, there is no good empirical evidence for theoretical psychoanalytic explanations of the efficacy of psychoanalysis, or for traditional theoretical explanations of the efficacy of other forms of professional psychotherapy.},

However, these power pose effects have recently come under considerable scrutiny. Here, we present a Bayesian meta-analysis of six preregistered studies from this special issue, focusing on the effect of power posing on felt power. Our analysis improves on standard classical meta-analyses in several ways. First and foremost, we considered only preregistered studies, eliminating concerns about publication bias. Second, the Bayesian approach enables us to quantify evidence for both the alternative and the null hypothesis. Third, we use Bayesian model-averaging to account for the uncertainty with respect to the choice for a fixed-effect model or a random-effect model. Fourth, based on a literature review, we obtained an empirically informed prior distribution for the between-study heterogeneity of effect sizes. This empirically informed prior can serve as a default choice not only for the investigation of the power pose effect but for effects in the field of psychology more generally. For effect size, we considered a default and an informed prior. Our meta-analysis yields very strong evidence for an effect of power posing on felt power. However, when the analysis is restricted to participants unfamiliar with the effect, the meta-analysis yields evidence that is only moderate.},

We argue that this taboo against causal inference in nonexperimental psychology impairs study design and data analysis, holds back cumulative research, leads to a disconnect between original findings and how they are interpreted in subsequent work, and limits the relevance of nonexperimental psychology for policymaking. At the same time, the taboo does not prevent researchers from interpreting findings as causal effects\textemdash the inference is simply made implicitly, and assumptions remain unarticulated. Thus, we recommend that nonexperimental psychologists begin to talk openly about causal assumptions and causal effects. Only then can researchers take advantage of recent methodological advances in causal reasoning and analysis and develop a solid understanding of the underlying causal mechanisms that can inform future research, theory, and policymakers.},

The SIMS is designed to assess the constructs of intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, external regulation, and amotivation (E. L. Deci \& R. M. Ryan, 1985, 1991) in field and laboratory settings. Five studies were conducted to develop and validate the SIMS. Overall, results show that the SIMS is composed of 4 internally consistent factors.

  abstract = {Studies have revealed that heuristics and accessible schemas may affect people's judgments about global warming. In two studies, participants were asked to report on beliefs regarding global warming while seated in a room in which a small tree or several trees had been placed. In one experimental condition, the tree possessed its foliage whereas in the other, the branches were bare. It was found that participants were more likely to believe in global warming in presence of the tree without foliage (Study 1), that this belief increased in presence of three rather than one tree without foliage (Study 2), and that other beliefs not related to global warming were not affected by the experimental conditions. These results reveal that surrounding physical cues do affect beliefs about global warming. The spreading activation theory is used to explain these results.

Despite this effort, only Piquero and Bouffard (2007) have provided an in-depth attempt to measure the redefined concept. This study replicates the Piquero and Bouffard measurement and a traditional measure of self-control in order to compare their effectiveness in predicting criminal or deviant behaviours. The data used come from a random sample of undergraduate students. Results indicate that the strength of the relationship between self-control and crime/deviance varies significantly based on the way self-control is measured.},

  abstract = {Statistical analysis of both experimental and observational data is central to medical research. Unfortunately, the process of conventional statistical analysis is poorly understood by many medical scientists. This is due, in part, to the counter-intuitive nature of the basic tools of traditional (frequency-based) statistical inference. For example, the proper definition of a conventional 95\% confidence interval is quite confusing. It is based upon the imaginary results of a series of hypothetical repetitions of the data generation process and subsequent analysis. Not surprisingly, this formal definition is often ignored and a 95\% confidence interval is widely taken to represent a range of values that is associated with a 95\% probability of containing the true value of the parameter being estimated. Working within the traditional framework of frequency-based statistics, this interpretation is fundamentally incorrect. It is perfectly valid, however, if one works within the framework of Bayesian statistics and assumes a `prior distribution' that is uniform on the scale of the main outcome variable. This reflects a limited equivalence between conventional and Bayesian statistics that can be used to facilitate a simple Bayesian interpretation based on the results of a standard analysis. Such inferences provide direct and understandable answers to many important types of question in medical research. For example, they can be used to assist decision making based upon studies with unavoidably low statistical power, where non-significant results are all too often, and wrongly, interpreted as implying `no effect'. They can also be used to overcome the confusion that can result when statistically significant effects are too small to be clinically relevant. This paper describes the theoretical basis of the Bayesian-based approach and illustrates its application with a practical example that investigates the prevalence of major cardiac defects in a cohort of children born using the assisted reproduction technique known as ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection).},

The findings suggested that the B-ESEM model, which took two sources of psychometric multidimensionality into account, provided the best fit to the data. Although the Machiavellian Personality Scale was dominated by the global Machiavellianism, the measurement quality of the subdomains varied, with the desire for control sub-factor being more clearly defined than the other three specific factors (i.e., amorality, desire for status, and distrust of others).

A sample of 74 married or cohabiting couples were recruited from the community to participate in the study.

The results showed that the interpersonal dimensions of trait perfectionism were negatively related to general sexual satisfaction and sexual satisfaction with the partner for both husbands and wives. After partialing out marital satisfaction and depression, the husband's sexual satisfaction was significantly negatively correlated with his own socially prescribed perfectionism and with his wife's ratings of other-oriented perfectionism. The wife's satisfaction was significantly negatively correlated both with her husband's socially prescribed perfectionism and with her own socially prescribed perfectionism, other-oriented perfectionism, and perfectionistic self-presentation. Regression analyses suggest that the wife's other-oriented perfectionism is a unique predictor of her general lower sexual satisfaction and her husband's lower satisfaction with her contribution to the sexual relationship. Overall, the findings suggest that perfectionistic expectations have an important role to play in sexual satisfaction in married couples.},

Methods are described to analyse both treatment effects and social influence, based on a description by a continuous time Markov chain model, where the states represent combinations of acts of the interacting individuals. These methods were applied to agonistic interactions of rats under the influence of subthreshold electrical stimulation at a specific site in the hypothalamus. Above the threshold intensity such stimulation induced attacks in a situation where there is normally no violent behaviour. Subthreshold experiments at different intensities were performed to study the relation between the activated neural mechanism and agonistic interactions without fighting. There were two behaviourally different periods during each observation period. The opponent's behaviour as well as current intensity significantly affected the experimental animal's behaviour in both periods, although the effects were different in the two periods. Both effects were most profound in the second period. In this period increased current intensity made experimental animals more self-directed and yet more reactive to the opponent's behaviour. Furthermore, opponents reduced the amount of contact behaviour shown by the experimental animals. Indeed it appears that their behaviour is aimed at reducing contact.},

In the present article, we contend that tests of social cognitive theories should adhere to the principles of nomological validity, defined as the degree to which predictions in a formal theoretical network are confirmed. We highlight the importance of nomological validity tests to ensure theory predictions can be disconfirmed through observation. We argue that researchers should be explicit on the conditions that lead to theory disconfirmation, and identify any auxiliary assumptions on which theory effects may be conditional. We contend that few researchers formally test nomological validity of theories or outline conditions leading to model rejection and the auxiliary assumptions that may explain findings that run counter to hypotheses, raising potential for `falsification evasion'. We present a brief analysis of studies (k = 122) testing four key social cognitive theories in health behavior to illustrate deficiencies in reporting theory tests and evaluations of nomological validity. Our analysis revealed that few articles report explicit statements suggesting that their findings support or reject the hypotheses of the theories tested, even when findings point to rejection. We illustrate the importance of explicit a priori specification of fundamental theory hypotheses and associated auxiliary assumptions, and identification of the conditions which would lead to rejection of theory predictions. We also demonstrate the value of confirmatory analytic techniques, meta-analytic structural equation modeling, and Bayesian analyses in providing robust converging evidence for nomological validity. We provide a set of guidelines for researchers on how to adopt and apply the nomological validity approach to testing health behavior models.},

This theory of method assembles a complex of specific strategies and methods of relevance to psychology that are employed in the detection of empirical phenomena and the subsequent construction of explanatory theories. A characterization of the nature of phenomena is given, and the process of their detection is briefly described in terms of a multistage model of data analysis. The construction of explanatory theories is shown to involve their generation through abductive, or explanatory, reasoning, their development through analogical modeling, and their fuller appraisal in terms of judgments of the best of competing explanations. The nature and limits of this theory of method are discussed in the light of relevant developments in scientific methodology. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Grounded in philosophical methodology, this book goes beyond understanding knowledge justification only as empirical validity, but instead emphasises the importance of theoretical criteria for all good research. The authors consider both~quantitative and qualitative research methods, and approach methodology from an interdisciplinary viewpoint.~~Using abductive reasoning as the starting point for an insightful journey into realist inquiry, this book demonstrates that scientific realism continues to be of major relevance to the social sciences.},

Despite the enormous amount of attention given to this topic, psychology's understanding of ToSS remains deficient. The major problem stems from a widespread and uncritical acceptance of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), which is an indefensible amalgam of ideas adapted from Fisher's thinking on the subject and from Neyman and Pearson's alternative account. To correct for the deficiencies of the hybrid, it is suggested that psychology avail itself of two important and more recent viewpoints on ToSS, namely the neo-Fisherian and the error-statistical perspectives. The neo-Fisherian perspective endeavors to improve on Fisher's original account and rejects key elements of Neyman and Pearson's alternative. In contrast, the error-statistical perspective builds on the strengths of both statistical traditions. It is suggested that these more recent outlooks on ToSS are a definite improvement on NHST, especially the error-statistical position. It is suggested that ToSS can play a useful, if limited, role in psychological research. At the end, some lessons learnt from the extensive debates about ToSS are presented.},

This theory has been both promoted and rejected by philosophers and scientists down through time. In this paper, we adopt the correspondence theory as a plausible theory of truth and relate it to science. First, we briefly outline the major extant theories of truth. We then present the correspondence theory in a form that enables us to show that the theory uniquely fulfills a crucial function in psychological research, because the interpretation of truth claims as suppositions that concern states of affairs in the world clearly explicates what it means for a theory to be true, and what it means for a theory to be false. For this reason, correspondence truth has the advantage of allowing researchers to properly understand the assumptions of scientific research as claims about the factual state of the world, and to scrutinize these assumptions. It is concluded that correspondence truth plays an important part in our understanding of science, including psychology.},

In its simplest form, this idea refers to a situation in which the existence of a misleading correlation between 2 variables is produced through the operation of a third causal variable. It is argued that this commonly accepted notion of a spurious correlation is not concerned with spuriousness proper. I begin the article by identifying 2 different notions of spurious correlation that are in current use. I then address the problem with the popular notion of spuriousness by presenting a typology of correlations that is differentiated in terms of presumed causes. This typology helps one to appreciate that so-called spurious correlations are really genuine, indirect correlations, whereas proper spurious correlations are accidental correlations that are not brought about by their claimed natural causes. In testing for spurious correlations, as they are erroneously understood, social scientists assume that causal relations are empirical regularities. I argue that spurious correlations, properly understood, require a notion of causes that are understood as generative mechanisms. Finally, I suggest that without this more expansive view of causation, one cannot regard third variables as latent variables that underlie and give rise to their manifest indicator variables. This is a requirement for properly differentiating between genuine and spurious correlations.},

Methods: Rates were analyzed with ordinary linear regression analysis. Secular trends were evaluated using ratio-statistic and its 95\% confidence intervals. Results: The rate of violent suicides increased before year 1990 and decreased since that. The nonviolent suicide rate increased continuously. The decreasing tendency of seasonality in nonviolent suicides and a slight decrease in violent suicides are seen within the three successive time periods studied. Conclusions: Trends in rates and in seasonality of suicides might be related to changes in the health politics in Finland. Limitations: The short time-series and lack of studying associations of suicides with socioeconomic, environmental or biological factors are limitations of our study. Clinical relevance: Studying the time-dependent changes in rates and in seasonality of suicides provide a novel perspective for the evaluation of the aetiology of suicidal behaviour.},

Here we report that the unilateral stimulation of the hypothalamic attack area per se induced an unilateral c-Fos activation of most brain nuclei involved in attack, and that attacks occurred only when cortical regions were also activated, and the activation of the medial amygdala and hypothalamic attack area were bilateral. This suggests that the hypothalamic attack area not only transmits information to lower brain structures but also activates forebrain structures involved in attack.},

  abstract = {A range of factors affect human response to environmental change. They include the information available, understanding of the phenomenon, the nature of the decision-making processes implied, and the motivation for change. One major factor affecting decision making is that scientific information is not fully and accurately disseminated through society. The media have an important role in this process, but cannot disseminate all the necessary information in the manner that is required and do not reliably present information that is safe from misinterpretation. Further, scientific uncertainty about and complexity of biosphere changes complicate the process of reaching a rational decision. The mental model that people have of their world tends to be maintained unless it is contradicted by experienced events, so global change is likely to be understood only to the extent that it impacts on everyday life. Much of human reasoning is essentially analogical rather than based on standard logic, and its validity depends on finding a suitable analogical model. It is suggested that risk, or defence situations may provide useful analogies. Finally, we need to consider the motivational problems created by the sacrifices that must be made to deal with the problem effectively. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Emphasis is on the way in which the methods cope with first- and second-order departures from normality. Percentile-t and accelerated bias-correction emerge as the most promising of existing techniques. Certain other methods are shown to lead to serious errors in coverage and position of critical point. An alternative approach, based on "shortest" bootstrap confidence intervals, is developed. We also make several more technical contributions. In particular, we confirm Efron's conjecture that accelerated bias-correction is second-order correct in a variety of multivariate circumstances, and give a simple interpretation of the acceleration constant.},

Normal perfectionists set realistic standards for themselves, derive pleasure from their painstaking labors, and are capable of choosing to be less precise in certain situations. Neurotic perfectionists, on the other hand, demand of themselves a usually unattainable level of performance, experience their efforts as unsatisfactory, and are unable to relax their standards. The development of neurotic perfectionism tends to occur in 1 of 2 kinds of emotive environments: (a) nonapproval or inconsistent approval in which parents fail to establish explicit performance standards for the child, or (b) parental expressions of conditional positive approval far exceed those of unconditional positive approval. Normal perfectionism tends to develop through either positive modeling (the close identification of the child with an emotionally important person) or negative modeling (the child rejects the behavior of an emotionally important person). Some symptoms describe both normal and neurotic perfectionists, but neurotic perfectionists experience them with greater intensity and for a longer duration. Four specific goals are stated which have proven useful in helping clients to change their neurotic perfectionism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Design PubMed and CAB Abstracts databases were searched through July 1, 2008, with use of controlled vocabulary specific to the databases, such as soy, isoflavones, genistein, phytoestrogens, red clover, androgen, testosterone, and SHBG. Peer-reviewed studies published in English were selected if [1] adult men consumed soy foods, isolated soy protein, or isoflavone extracts (from soy or red clover) and [2] circulating T, SHBG, free T, or calculated FAI was assessed. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Isoflavone exposure was abstracted directly from studies. Main Outcome Measure(s) Fifteen placebo-controlled treatment groups with baseline and ending measures were analyzed. In addition, 32 reports involving 36 treatment groups were assessed in simpler models to ascertain the results. Result(s) No significant effects of soy protein or isoflavone intake on T, SHBG, free T, or FAI were detected regardless of statistical model. Conclusion(s) The results of this meta-analysis suggest that neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable T concentrations in men.},

  abstract = {U.S. public opinion regarding climate change has become increasingly polarized in recent years, as partisan think tanks and others worked to recast an originally scientific topic into a political wedge issue. Nominally ``scientific'' arguments against taking anthropogenic climate change seriously have been publicized to reach informed but ideologically receptive audiences. Reflecting the success of such arguments, polls have noted that concern about climate change increased with education among Democrats, but decreased with education among Republicans. These observations lead to the hypothesis that there exist interaction (non-additive) effects between education or knowledge and political orientation, net of other background factors, in predicting public concern about climate change. Two regional telephone surveys, conducted in New Hampshire (n = 541) and Michigan (n = 1, 008) in 2008, included identical climate-change questions that provide opportunities to test this hypothesis. Multivariate analysis of both surveys finds significant interactions. These empirical results fit with theoretical interpretations and several other recent studies. They suggest that the classically identified social bases of concern about the environment in general, and climate in particular, have shifted in recent years. Narrowcast media, including the many Web sites devoted to discrediting climate-change concerns, provide ideal conduits for channeling contrarian arguments to an audience predisposed to believe and electronically spread them further. Active-response Web sites by climate scientists could prove critical to counterbalancing contrarian arguments.},

  abstract = {Questions about climate change elicit some of the widest political divisions of any items on recent U.S. surveys. Severe polarization affects even basic questions about the reality of anthropogenic climate change (ACC), or whether most scientists agree that humans are changing the Earth's climate. Statements about scientific consensus have been contentious among social scientists, with some arguing for consensus awareness as a ``gateway cognition'' that leads to greater public acceptance of ACC, but others characterizing consensus messaging (deliberate communication about the level of scientific agreement) as a counterproductive tactic that exacerbates polarization. A series of statewide surveys, with nationwide benchmarks, repeated questions about the reality of ACC and scientific consensus many times over 2010 to 2016. These data permit tests for change in beliefs and polarization. ACC and consensus beliefs have similar trends and individual background predictors. Both rose gradually by about 10 points over 2010 to 2016, showing no abrupt shifts that might correspond to events such as scientific reports, leadership statements, or weather. Growing awareness of the scientific consensus, whether from deliberate messaging or the cumulative impact of many studies and publicly engaged scientists, provides the most plausible explanation for this rise in both series. In state-level data, the gap between liberal and conservative views on the reality of ACC did not widen over this period, whereas the liberal\textendash conservative gap regarding existence of a scientific consensus narrowed.},

  abstract = {A simple question about climate change, with one choice designed to match consensus statements by scientists, was asked on 35 US nationwide, single-state or regional surveys from 2010 to 2015. Analysis of these data (over 28,000 interviews) yields robust and exceptionally well replicated findings on public beliefs about anthropogenic climate change, including regional variations, change over time, demographic bases, and the interacting effects of respondent education and political views. We find that more than half of the US public accepts the scientific consensus that climate change is happening now, caused mainly by human activities. A sizable, politically opposite minority (about 30 to 40\%) concede the fact of climate change, but believe it has mainly natural causes. Few (about 10 to 15\%) say they believe climate is not changing, or express no opinion. The overall proportions appear relatively stable nationwide, but exhibit place-to-place variations. Detailed analysis of 21 consecutive surveys within one fairly representative state (New Hampshire) finds a mild but statistically significant rise in agreement with the scientific consensus over 2010\textendash 2015. Effects from daily temperature are detectable but minor. Hurricane Sandy, which brushed New Hampshire but caused no disaster there, shows no lasting impact on that state's time series\textemdash suggesting that non-immediate weather disasters have limited effects. In all datasets political orientation dominates among individual-level predictors of climate beliefs, moderating the otherwise positive effects from education. Acceptance of anthropogenic climate change rises with education among Democrats and Independents, but not so among Republicans. The continuing series of surveys provides a baseline for tracking how future scientific, political, socioeconomic or climate developments impact public acceptance of the scientific consensus.},

In general, the slip rate and hence the seismicity of a fault decreases during loading and increases during unloading. Here, we present several case studies to show that a postglacial slip rate increase occurred on faults worldwide in regions where ice caps and lakes decayed at the end of the last glaciation. Of note is that the postglacial amplification of seismicity was not restricted to the areas beneath the large Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets but also occurred in regions affected by smaller ice caps or lakes, e.g. the Basin-and-Range Province. Our results do not only have important consequences for the interpretation of palaeoseismological records from faults in these regions but also for the evaluation of the future seismicity in regions currently affected by deglaciation like Greenland and Antarctica: shrinkage of the modern ice sheets owing to global warming may ultimately lead to an increase in earthquake frequency in these regions.},

This paper outlines the major theories of measurement and their relationships and describes the different kinds of models and hypotheses which may be formulated within each theory.

  abstract = {Twenty years ago, Ringo and colleagues proposed that maintaining absolute connectivity in larger compared with smaller brains is computationally inefficient due to increased conduction delays in transcallosal information transfer and expensive with respect to the brain mass needed to establish these additional connections. Therefore, they postulated that larger brains are relatively stronger connected intrahemispherically and smaller brains interhemispherically, resulting in stronger functional lateralization in larger brains. We investigated neuronal interconnections in 138 large and small human brains using diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tractography. We found a significant interaction between brain size and the type of connectivity. Structural intrahemispheric connectivity is stronger in larger brains, whereas interhemispheric connectivity is only marginally increased in larger compared with smaller brains. Although brain size and gender are confounded, this effect is gender-independent. Additionally, the ratio of interhemispheric to intrahemispheric connectivity correlates inversely with brain size. The hypothesis of neuronal interconnectivity as a function of brain size might account for shorter and more symmetrical interhemispheric transfer times in women and for empirical evidence that visual and auditory processing are stronger lateralized in men. The hypothesis additionally shows that differences in interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity are driven by brain size and not by gender, a finding contradicting a recently published study. Our findings are also compatible with the idea that the more asymmetric a region is, the smaller the density of interhemispheric connections, but the larger the density of intrahemispheric connections. The hypothesis represents an organization principle of the human connectome that might be applied also to non-human animals as suggested by our cross-species comparison.},

  abstract = {We use a three-dimensional climate model, the Goddard Institute for  Space Studies (GISS) model II with 8\textdegree{} by 10\textdegree{} horizontal  resolution, to simulate the global climate effects of time-dependent  variations at atmospheric trace gases and aerosols. Horizontal heat  transport by the ocean is fixed at values estimated for today's climate,  and the uptake of heat perturbations by the ocean beneath the mixed  layer is approximated as vertical diffusion. We make a 100-year control  run and perform experiments for three scenarios of atmospheric  composition. These experiments begin in 1958 and include measured or  estimated changes in atmospheric CO2, CH4,  N2O, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and stratospheric aerosols  for the period from 1958 to the present. Scenario A assumes continued  exponential trace gas growth, scenario B assumes a reduced linear growth  of trace gases, and scenario C assumes a rapid curtailment of trace gas  emissions such that the net climate forcing ceases to increase after the  year 2000.  Principal results from the experiments are as  follows: (1) Global warming to the level attained at the peak of the  current interglacial and the previous interglacial occurs in all three  scenarios; however, there are dramatic differences in the levels of  future warming, depending on trace gas growth. (2) The greenhouse  warming should be clearly identifiable in the 1990s; the global warming  within the next several years is predicted to reach and maintain a level  at least three standard deviations above the climatology of the 1950s.  (3) Regions where an unambiguous warming appears earliest are  low-latitude oceans, China and interior areas in Asia, and ocean areas  near Antarctica and the north pole; aspects of the spatial and temporal  distribution of predicted warming are clearly model-dependent implying  the possibility of model discrimination by the 1990s and thus improved  predictions, if appropriate observations are acquired. (4) The  temperature changes are sufficiently large to have major impacts on  people and other parts of the biosphere, as shown by computed changes in  the frequency of extreme events and by comparison with previous climate  trends. (5) The model results suggest some near-term regional climate  variations, despite the fixed ocean heat transport which suppresses many  possible regional climate fluctuations; for example, during the late  1980s and in the 1990s there is a tendency for greater than average  warming in the southeastern and central United States and relatively  cooler conditions or less than average warming in the western United  State and much of Europe.  Principal uncertainties in the  predictions involve the equilibrium sensitivity of the model to climate  forcing, the assumptions regarding heat uptake and transport by the  ocean, and the omission of other less-certain climate forcings.},

But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (`analytic reproducibility'). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

To differentiate between these two stages it is popular to describe the former as involving the accommodation of data and the latter as involving the prediction of data. Predictivism is the view that, ceteris paribus, correctly predicting data confers greater confirmation than successfully accommodating data. In this paper, I take issue with a variety of predictivist theses, argue that their role for issues of confirmation is extremely limited, and attempt to account for the appeal that predictivism has enjoyed.

A worked example demonstrates how to apply these statistical tools and interpret the results. Finally, we explain how no statistical approach can actually prove that the null-hypothesis is true, and briefly discuss the philosophical differences between statistical approaches to examine null-effects. The increasing availability of easy-to-use software and online tools to perform equivalence tests, Bayesian estimation, and calculate Bayes factors make it timely and feasible to complement or move beyond traditional null-hypothesis tests, and allow researchers to draw more informative conclusions about null-effects.},

Unfortunately, there is a great deal of controversy surrounding how data derived from these tools can and should be analyzed. One issue that is repeatedly raised is whether these data are ordinal or continuous. A related question is whether parametric data analysis techniques are appropriate and/or acceptable for these rating scale data. Some of this controversy may stem from a misunderstanding of fundamental issues related to these particular tools or a poor use of terminology. This article provides a review of basic issues surrounding measurement of various phenomena relevant to educational settings, as well as previous empirical studies examining the effects of using parametric analysis approaches on rating scale data. Based on previous empirical evidence reviewed in this article, parametric analytical approaches are acceptable provided certain criteria are met. Implications for research and teaching are also briefly discussed. After reading this article, the reader should be able to identify the characteristics of a true Likert scale and explain the situations when parametric analytical techniques are potentially appropriate for rating scale data or when nonparametric techniques are preferred.},

He has inspired a generation of scholars, both for the ways in which his research is carried out and his profound insights. For Harre, the stunning discoveries of research demand a kind of thinking that is found in the construction and control of models. Iconic modeling is pivotal for representing real-world structures, explaining phenomena, manipulating instruments, constructing theories, and acquiring data. This volume in the new Elsevier book series, "Studies in Multidisciplinarity" includes major topics on the structure and function of models, the debates over scientific realism, explanation through analogical modeling, a metaphysics for physics, the rationale for experimentation, and modeling in social encounters.},

The few studies undertaken have generally relied on ambient temperature as a measure of stress. In the present work, a discomfort index was related to the incidence of aggravated assault in Dallas, Texas, for an eight-month period from March through October 1980. Some 4000 assault events were aggregated on a daily basis and related to three variables: discomfort index, day of the week, and month. The resulting model accounted for 71\% of the variation in assault incidence. The discomfort index yielded significant F statistics whether entered first, second, or third in the model, indicating a significant main effect in spite of its collinearity with month. The analysis supports experimental laboratory evidence suggesting that heat stress is associated with aggressive behavior.},

A dearth of field studies prompted the analysis reported here, which is based on data for some 10,000 aggravated assaults occurring the City of Dallas in 1980 (a summer of severe heat stress) and 1981. This analysis replicates and extends certain aspects of recent work by Anderson and Anderson (1984) relating to the so-called linear and curvilinear hypotheses. Thermal stress is measured in two ways: a Discomfort Index (DI), which takes into account the influence of humidity acting in concert with temperature, and ambient temperature. Regression analyses were performed in two stages. In the first, data for all neighborhoods and all days of the study period were combined into ambient temperature and DI models. At the second stage, models differentiated between the three levels of neighborhood socioeconomic status. With weekend controlled, DI and ambient temperature were significant independent variables in the 'overall' model and in medium and low status neighborhoods. However, when linear effects were controlled, the curvilinear measures were never significant. The analysis generally tended to confirm Anderson and Anderson's suggestion that a reduction of aggression with increasing temperature does not appear to occur within the normal range of temperatures. This analysis further suggested that the hypothesized curvilinear effect is weak, if not entirely absent, even during conditions of extreme heat.},

  abstract = {Measures that are reliable, valid and can be used across diverse populations are vital to social work research, but the development of new measures is an expensive and time-consuming process. An array of existing measures can provide a cost-effective alternative, but in order to take this expedient step with confidence, researchers must ensure that the existing measure is appropriate for the new study. Confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) is one way to do so, and in this clearly written pocket guide Donna Harrington provides social work researchers with an essential roadmap to the highlights of CFA's powers and how to harness them.CFA has four primary functions-- psychometric evaluation of measures, construct validation, testing method effects, and testing measurement invariance-- all of which Harrington makes exceedingly accessible. She includes an easy-to-follow overview of the method, step-by-step guides to creating a CFA model and assessing its fit, and clear explanations of the requirements for using CFA, as well as underscoring the issues that are necessary to consider in alternative situations, such as when multiple groups are involved. Real-world examples, screenshots from the Amos software program that can be used to conduct CFA, and reading suggestions for each chapter make the material accessible for even the greenest novice.This pocket guide is ideally suited for readers who plan to conduct CFA analyses and need a brief, non-technical introduction to the topic to get them started before getting into the more detailed and technical literature, as well as readers who do not plan to conduct CFA analyses, but want to be knowledgeable consumers of research literature that uses CFA.},

This article sets ups a model in which the level of the process generating the observations changes over time. A recursion analogous to the Kalman filter is used to construct the likelihood function and to make predictions of future observations. Qualitative variables, based on a binomial or multinomial distribution, may be handled in a similar way. The model for count data may be extended to include explanatory variables. This enables nonstochastic slope and seasonal components to be included in the model, as well as permitting intervention analysis. The techniques are illustrated with a number of applications, and an attempt is made to develop a model-selection strategy along the lines of that used for Gaussian structural time series models. The applications include an analysis of the results of international football matches played between England and Scotland and an assessment of the effect of the British seat-belt law on the drivers of light-goods vehicles.},

This means that data possessing an ordinal scale will not satisfy the assumption of normality needed in many statistical procedures and may produce biased statistical results that threaten the validity of inferences. This article shows how the measurement technique known as item response theory can be used to rescale ordinal data to an interval scale. The authors provide examples of rescaling using student performance data and argue that educational researchers should routinely consider rescaling ordinal data using item response theory.},

However, people's responses are also influenced by their response style. Hence, the studies we conduct might simply reflect differences in the way people respond to surveys, rather than picking up real differences in management phenomena across countries. Our 26-country study shows that there are major differences in response styles between countries that both confirm and extend earlier research. Country-level characteristics such as power distance, collectivism, uncertainty avoidance and extraversion all significantly influence response styles such as acquiescence and extreme response styles. Further, English-language questionnaires are shown to elicit a higher level of middle responses, while questionnaires in a respondent's native language result in more extreme response styles. Finally, English-language competence is positively related to extreme response styles and negatively related to middle response styles.

The important variables were mortality rate for all causes of death, the age of the population, average family income, population density, proportion with no religious affiliation, proportion of Francophones, unemployment, immigration, proportion of Native people, a regional effect for British Columbia and the north, and growth by mobility, explaining 62\% of the observed variation. This spatial ecologic analysis highlights the importance of cultural differences in explaining the variation of suicide rates. Results show a negative relative governing suicide and the variables of income, unemployment, and age distribution.},

  abstract = {The primary assumption within the recent personality and political orientations literature is that personality traits cause people to develop political attitudes. In contrast, research relying on traditional psychological and developmental theories suggests the relationship between most personality dimensions and political orientations are either not significant or weak. Research from behavioral genetics suggests the covariance between personality and political preferences is not causal, but due to a common, latent genetic factor that mutually influences both. The contradictory assumptions and findings from these research streams have yet to be resolved. This is in part due to the reliance on cross-sectional data and the lack of longitudinal genetically informative data. Here, using two independent longitudinal genetically informative samples, we examine the joint development of personality traits and attitude dimensions to explore the underlying causal mechanisms that drive the relationship between these features and provide a first step in resolving the causal question. We find change in personality over a ten-year period does not predict change in political attitudes, which does not support a causal relationship between personality traits and political attitudes as is frequently assumed. Rather, political attitudes are often more stable than the key personality traits assumed to be predicting them. Finally, the results from our genetic models find that no additional variance is accounted for by the causal pathway from personality traits to political attitudes. Our findings remain consistent with the original construction of the five-factor model of personality and developmental theories on attitude formation, but challenge recent work in this area.},

Indices based on answer patterns, reliability, components and factor analysis, and latent traits are reviewed. It is shown that many of the indices lack a rationale, and that many are adjustments of a previous index to take into account some criticisms of it. After reviewing many indices, it is suggested that those based on the size of residuals after fitting a two- or three-parameter latent trait model may be the most useful to detect unidimensionality. An attempt is made to clarify the term unidimensional, and it is shown how it differs from other terms often used inter changeably such as reliability, internal consistency, and homogeneity. Reliability is defined as the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. Inter nal consistency denotes a group of methods that are intended to estimate reliability, are based on the vari ances and the covariances of test items, and depend on only one administration of a test. Homogeneity seems to refer more specifically to the similarity of the item correlations, but the term is often used as a synonym for unidimensionality. The usefulness of the terms in ternal consistency and homogeneity is questioned. Uni dimensionality is defined as the existence of one latent trait underlying the data.},

  abstract = {The threat to reproducibility and awareness of current rates of research misbehavior sparked initiatives to better academic science. One initiative is preregistration of quantitative research. We investigate whether the preregistration format could also be used to boost the credibility of qualitative research. A crucial distinction underlying preregistration is that between prediction and postdiction. In qualitative research, data are used to decide which way interpretation should move forward, using data to generate hypotheses and new research questions. Qualitative research is thus a real-life example of postdiction research. Some may object to the idea of preregistering qualitative studies because qualitative research generally does not test hypotheses, and because qualitative research design is typically flexible and subjective. We rebut these objections, arguing that making hypotheses explicit is just one feature of preregistration, that flexibility can be tracked using preregistration, and that preregistration would provide a check on subjectivity. We then contextualize preregistrations alongside another initiative to enhance credibility in qualitative research: the confirmability audit. Besides, preregistering qualitative studies is practically useful to combating dissemination bias and could incentivize qualitative researchers to report constantly on their study's development. We conclude with suggested modifications to the Open Science Framework preregistration form to tailor it for qualitative studies.},

Aims To assess the impact of the Princess's death on suicide and deliberate self-harm (DSH). Method Analysis, using Poisson regression, of the number of suicides and open verdicts (`suicides') in England and Wales following the Princess's death compared to the 3 months beforehand, and the equivalent periods in 1992-1996. Similar analysis on DSH presentations to a general hospital. Results Suicides increased during the month following the Princess's funeral (+17.4\%). This was particularly marked in females (+33.7\%), especially those aged 25-44 years (+45.1\%). Suicides did not fall in the week between the death and the funeral. Presentations for DSH increased significantly during the week following the death (+44.3\%), especially in females (+65.1\%). Examination of case notes suggested that the influence of the death was largely through amplification of personal losses or exacerbation of existing distress. Conclusions The death of a major public figure can influence rates of suicidal behaviour. For DSH, the impact may be immediate, but for suicide it may be delayed.},

The theory includes other predictions, however, that have received far less scrutiny. Among these is the argument that self-control is developed early in childhood and that individual differences emerging then persist over time. The purpose of this study is to provide a rigorous test of the stability thesis. First, we examine the extent of stability and change in self-control for a national sample of U.S. children age 7 to age 15. Second, we consider whether parenting continues to affect self-control during adolescence\textemdash a period after the point at which self-control differences should be fixed. The analysis revealed strong absolute and relative stability of self-control for more than 80 percent of the sample, and this stability emerged in large part as early as age 7. Contradicting the theory was a smaller portion of respondents (roughly 16 percent) who experienced substantial absolute and relative changes in self-control even after the age of 10. Moreover, parental socialization continued to affect self-control during adolescence, even after accounting for both prior self-control and exposure to parental socialization.},

Psychol Methods 2002] employed a structural equation model of measurements of target cell lysing by natural killer cells as an example purportedly demonstrating that small but statistically significant ill model fit can be dismissed as "negligible from a practical point of view".METHODS:Reanalysis of the natural killer cell data reveals that the supposedly negligible ill fit obscured important, systematic, and substantial causal misspecifications.RESULTS:A clean-fitting structural equation model indicates that measurements employing higher natural-killer-cell to target-cell ratios are more strongly influenced by a progressively intrusive factor, whether or not the natural killer cell activity is activated by recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma). The progressive influence may reflect independent rate limiting steps in cell recognition and attachment, spatial competition for cell attachment points, or the simultaneous lysings of single target cells by multiple natural killer cells.CONCLUSIONS:If the progressively influential factor is ultimately identified as a mere procedural impediment, the substantive conclusion will be that measurements of natural killer cell activity made at lower effector to target ratios are more valid. Alternatively, if the individual variations in the progressively influential factor are modifiable, this may presage a new therapeutic route to enhancing natural killer cell activity. The methodological conclusion is that, when using structural equation models, researchers should attend to significant model ill fit even if the degree of covariance ill fit is small, because small covariance residuals do not imply that the underlying model misspecifications are correspondingly small or inconsequential.},

  abstract = {Children growing up today are confronted by four difficult and intersecting challenges: dangerous environmental change, weakening democracies, growing social inequality, and a global economy marked by unprecedented youth unemployment and unsustainable resource extraction. Yet on streets everywhere, there is also a strong, youthful energy for change. This book sets out an inspiring new agenda for citizenship and environmental education which reflects the responsibility and opportunities facing educators, researchers, parents and community groups to support young citizens as they learn to 'make a difference' on the issues that concern them. Controversial yet ultimately hopeful, political scientist Bronwyn Hayward rethinks assumptions about youth citizenship in neoliberal democracies. Her comparative discussion draws on lessons from New Zealand, a country where young citizens often express a strong sense of personal responsibility for their planet but where many children also face shocking social conditions. Hayward develops a 'SEEDS' model of ecological citizenship education (Social agency, Environmental Education, Embedded justice, Decentred deliberative democracy and Self transcendence). The discussion considers how the SEEDs model can support young citizens' democratic imagination and develop their 'handprint' for social justice. From eco-worriers and citizen-scientists to streetwise sceptics, Children, Citizenship and Environment identifies a variety of forms of citizenship and discusses why many approaches make it more difficult, not easier, for young citizens to effect change. This book will be of interest to a wide audience, in particular teachers of children aged eight to twelve and professionals who work in Environmental Citizenship Education as well as students and researchers with an interest in environmental change, democracy and intergenerational justice. Introduced by Tim Jackson, author of Prosperity without Growth, the book includes forewords by leading European and USA academics, Andrew Dobson and Roger Hart. Half the author's royalties will be donated to child poverty projects following the earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand.

We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

Measurement error is shown to attenuate estimates of effect size and a correction is given. The effects of measurement invalidity are discussed.

The study aims to evaluate the influence of temperature on suicide mortality, especially on multi-decadal and longer time scales, that is, at scales on which the ongoing warming distinctly operates and is correspondingly appropriate for the current policy responses to warming climate. Methods Our results are based on an extraordinarily long record of deaths from suicide in Finland from 1751 to 2008, and a similarly long climatic record of ambient temperatures correlative of environmental change in the study region. Results We show that temperature variability explains more than 60 \% of the total suicide variance up until the initiation of a national suicide prevention program. Despite ongoing warming, suicide rates have declined since the initiation of the program. Conclusion By understanding the complexity of suicidal behavior as a response to ambient warming and the observed effects of interventions, our results underline the pressing need for a network of prevention programs to battle against temperature-mediated health hazards.},

In 2015, we conducted a follow-up survey of 237 mothers enrolled in a 2-arm clinic-level cluster randomized trial (n = 488) in Washington State that was completed in 2013. We surveyed mothers at their baby's birth, age 6 months, and age 24 months using a validated measure of vaccine hesitancy. Both mean hesitancy scores (mean 4.1-point reduction; 95\% CI, 2.5-5.6; P = .01) and the proportion of mothers who were vaccine hesitant (9.7\% at baseline vs 5.9\% at 24 months; P = .01) decreased significantly from child's birth to age 24 months. Changes from baseline were similar for first-time mothers and experienced mothers. Individual item analysis suggested that the decrease may have been driven by increases in maternal confidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Our results suggest that hesitancy is a dynamic measure that may peak around childbirth and may remit as experience with vaccines accumulates.},

All were administered the 10th version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Inventory for the Assessment of Factors of Aggressiveness. They also were interviewed carefully in regards to both impulsive and self-mutilative behavior. A d-fenfluramine challenge test was administered to 36 females and prolactin levels were measured.

I propose that, independent of outcomes or value from worth, people experience a regulatory fit when they use goal pursuit means that fit their regulatory orientation, and this regulatory fit increases the value of what they are doing. The following postulates of this value from fit proposal are examined: (a) People will be more inclined toward goal means that have higher regulatory fit, (b) people's motivation during goal pursuit will be stronger when regulatory fit is higher, (c) people's (prospective) feelings about a choice they might make will be more positive for a desirable choice and more negative for an undesirable choice when regulatory fit is higher, (d) people's (retrospective) evaluations of past decisions or goal pursuits will be more positive when regulatory fit was higher, and (e) people will assign higher value to an object that was chosen with higher regulatory fit. Studies testing each of these postulates support the value-from fit proposal. How value from fit can enhance or diminish the value of goal pursuits and the quality of life itself is discussed.},

Self-oriented perfectionism was strongly associated with conscientiousness, and with the achievement striving subscale in particular. Self-oriented perfectionism was also modestly associated with facets of neuroticism and agreeableness. Other-oriented perfectionism was inversely associated with agreeableness. Socially-prescribed perfectionism was associated only with the depression subscale of the neuroticism factor. Self-oriented perfectionism appeared predominately adaptive, while other-oriented and socially-prescribed perfectionism appeared predominately maladaptive.

  abstract = {The influence of weather on mood and mental health is commonly debated. Furthermore, studies concerning weather and suicidal behavior have given inconsistent results. Our aim was to see if daily weather changes associate with the number of suicide attempts in Finland. All suicide attempts treated in the hospitals in Helsinki, Finland, during two separate periods, 8 years apart, were included. Altogether, 3,945 suicide attempts were compared with daily weather parameters and analyzed with a Poisson regression. We found that daily atmospheric pressure correlated statistically significantly with the number of suicide attempts, and for men the correlation was negative. Taking into account the seasonal normal value during the period 1971\textendash 2000, daily temperature, global solar radiation and precipitation did not associate with the number of suicide attempts on a statistically significant level in our study. We concluded that daily atmospheric pressure may have an impact on suicidal behavior, especially on suicide attempts of men by violent methods (P {$<$} 0.001), and may explain the clustering of suicide attempts. Men seem to be more vulnerable to attempt suicide under low atmospheric pressure and women under high atmospheric pressure. We show only statistical correlations, which leaves the exact mechanisms of interaction between weather and suicidal behavior open. However, suicidal behavior should be assessed from the point of view of weather in addition to psychiatric and social aspects.},

  abstract = {Suicides and attempted suicides in relation to weather and daylight in Finland, from 1969 to 2010  Suicide statistics show higher figures during spring and summer compared to autumn and winter. No explanation to this phenomenon has been found, but seasonal changes in weather have been suspected to be involved.  The objective of this study was to find out whether correlation between suicide statistics and weather variables exists in Finland. Suicide statistics from 1969 to 2010 in Finland were compared to daily, monthly, and annual weather data, on the national level as well as in the Helsinki, Jyv\"askyl\"a and Oulu regions.  Suicide mortality was at its highest between May 15 and July 25. During that period the day length is at its longest. No weather correlation as to that period was found. However, temperature did correlate with suicide mortality on an annual basis, and more clearly during winter; the lower the temperature was, the lower the suicide rate was. Furthermore, global solar radiation correlated negatively with suicide mortality between September and April. These correlations were more pronounced among men, and in the Helsinki region. For attempted suicides, in the Helsinki region, a correlation with atmospheric pressure was found. For women the correlation was positive, but for men, it was negative.  Any biological or social mechanisms that may contribute to these correlations remain currently unknown. However, the biological intrinsic clock which follows the light-dark cycle cannot be ruled out as a biological mechanism. Furthermore, earlier studies have shown correlations between hormonal changes and weather variables. In severe depressive disorder, which is a major risk factor for suicide, disruptions in the biological rhythms, and hormone secretions do occur, but it is not known to which extent these disruptions might be triggered due to weather conditions.  Therefore, more research is needed to evaluate the clinical significance and implications of these findings, and to further improve suicide prevention.},

It was expected that prosocial interaction with the homeless would produce shifts in attitudes and behavioral intentions toward the homeless and homelessness and result in greater attributions of external causes to explain homelessness. Nineteen experimental participants worked 15 hours at a local homeless shelter. Their responses to a posttest questionnaire that measured a range of attitudinal and behavioral orientations toward the homeless were compared with control participants who did not work at the shelter. Subsequent analyses furnished strong evidence of positive changes in attitudes and intentions toward homelessness among the shelter workers. These participants evaluated homeless people as less blameworthy and more socially attractive than did control participants; moreover, shelter workers indicated more personal responsibility and behavioral commitment to helping the homeless than control participants. They also perceived the homeless problem to be more serious and were more likely to attribute homelessness to bad luck than control participants. However, the two groups were equally likely to attribute homelessness to various external causes such as the economy, housing costs, and governmental policies. The results are interpreted as having policy implications for volunteer service.},

  abstract = {Military operations in tropical environments have imposed a significant challenge to the Australian Defence Forces (ADF). The hot and humid conditions are known to cause debilitating effects on soldiers deployed to northern regions of Australia, with the consequence that the effectiveness and efficiency of operations are severely compromised. While the adverse effects of thermal stress on soldiers' physiological capability are well established, this has not been confirmed for cognitive performance. A select range of psychometric tests were administered and functional brain electrical activity imaging was performed to investigate the impact of thermal stress on cognitive performance. The brain electrical activity of subjects was measured while undertaking a range of cognitive tasks. Steady State Probe Topography (SSPT), a novel brain imaging technology, was employed to monitor the changes in regional brain activity and neural processing speed of subjects under thermal stress. The psychometric test batteries included the following tasks; Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; Inspection Time; Digit Span test; a spatial working memory task; and the AX-continuous performance task. These tasks measure a range of cognitive processes including attention, memory, verbal learning, information processing and concentration. The functional brain imaging provided topographical information, which showed changes in electrical activity in response to thermal stress during cognitive performance. These changes in brain electrical activity and neural speed induced by thermal stress may help to identify the type of cognitive functions that are likely to be impaired under operational conditions. Results indicated that subjects experienced increasing cardiovascular strain through thermally neutral to thermally straining conditions. The results from the psychometric test battery showed some promising effects given the small sample size including deficits in working memory, in information retention and in information processing. There was also marked differences in the electrical responses of the brain when subjects were thermally strained. The Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential recordings showed an increase in amplitude and a decrease in latency, suggesting an increase in the utilisation of neural resources or effort by subjects to maintain the same level of performance as under thermally neutral conditions. The data are suggestive of the high sensitivity of brain imaging techniques with high temporal resolution to identify important decrements in cognitive performance in hostile environments.},

In published articles, however, little information tends to be reported on whether the data satisfy the assumptions underlying the statistical techniques used. This could be due to self-selection: Only manuscripts with data fulfilling the assumptions are submitted. Another explanation could be that violations of assumptions are rarely checked for in the first place. We studied whether and how 30 researchers checked fictitious data for violations of assumptions in their own working environment. Participants were asked to analyze the data as they would their own data, for which often used and well-known techniques such as the t-procedure, ANOVA and regression (or non-parametric alternatives) were required. It was found that the assumptions of the techniques were rarely checked, and that if they were, it was regularly by means of a statistical test. Interviews afterward revealed a general lack of knowledge about assumptions, the robustness of the techniques with regards to the assumptions, and how (or whether) assumptions should be checked. These data suggest that checking for violations of assumptions is not a well-considered choice, and that the use of statistics can be described as opportunistic.},

Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students\textemdash all in the field of psychology\textemdash were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers' performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

The aim of the present study was to explore how risk and protective factors for suicide interact with one another in a network sense and to determine which factors were most central to a network of these factors.Method: Using an online survey, cross-sectional data were collected from a sample of 515 individuals who lived in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Participants were recruited through either social media or Prolific Academic. A network of 18 risk and protective factors for suicide was estimated using network analysis. Analyses were preregistered on the Open Science Framework.Results: Factors that had the highest strength centrality were feeling depressed, feeling hopeless, perceived burdensomeness, self-esteem, and social support. Factors that were directly associated with suicidal ideation included feeling depressed, perceived burdensomeness, feeling hopeless, self-esteem, resilience, access to mental health services and a positive attitude toward these services.Conclusion: This research demonstrates the importance of examining protective factors as well as risk factors when estimating an individual's suicide risk. The results suggest that interventions targeting depression may be particularly beneficial in reducing suicide risk, but further longitudinal research is required.HIGHLIGHTSThe network analyses estimated depression to be the most central risk factor.Depression and perceived burdensomeness were risk factors for suicidal ideation.Self-esteem and resilience were protective against suicidal ideation.},

  abstract = {Several studies show a peak in suicide rates during springtime and suggest differences in the seasonal variation of suicides. However, the seasonal distribution of the temperature impact on suicide is less clear. This study investigated the relationship between diurnal temperature range (DTR) on suicide mortality. Daily temperature and suicide data for Helsinki were analyzed for the period of 1973\textendash 2010 inclusive. Overall, DTR reached its maximum during the spring from mid-April to mid-June, which is also the season with highest suicide mortality in the study region. Specifically, the seasonal timing and maxima for both DTR and suicides vary from year to year. Time series analysis of DTR and suicide records revealed a significant (P {$<$} 0.01) correlation between the springtime DTR maxima and suicide rates for males. No similar association could be found for females. These results provide evidence that a higher springtime DTR could be linked statistically to a higher seasonal suicide rate each spring, whereas the exact timing of the DTR peak did not associate with the seasonal suicide rate. A possible mechanism behind the springtime association between the DTR and suicides originates from brown adipose tissue (BAT) over-activity. Activation of BAT through the winter improves cold tolerance at the cost of heat tolerance. This might trigger anxiety and psychomotor agitation, affecting mood in a negative way. As a hypothesis, the compromised heat tolerance is suggested to increase the risk of death from suicide.},

The aim of our study is to detect any seasonal peaks in suicide rates and examine their temporal evolution to suggest a mechanism that may explain such peaks. Method We acquired the study material from the Finnish and Swedish cause of death statistics (257,341 deaths by suicide) and the relevant population gender structure data. We then separately calculated the annual male and female suicide rates per 100,000 inhabitants. We analysed the suicide peaks, calculating factors of proportionality for the available data by dividing the suicide rates in the peak months (May and October) by the annual suicide rates. Results Suicide rates in Finland and Sweden peak twice a year. Both men and women in both countries most often commit suicide in May. There is another peak in October, with the exception of Finnish men. These suicide peaks coincide with a temperature increase in May and the biggest annual drop in temperature in October. We also observed a monotonic long-term change in the Swedish statistics, but not in the Finnish data. Our hypothesis is that seasonal variation in suicide rates may be caused by abrupt temperature changes twice a year that trigger the activity in brown adipose tissue and deepen depression. Conclusion While the overall suicide mortality rates varied considerably, the monthly proportions in May did not. This finding suggests a routine factor underlying the spring peak in suicide mortality.},

Finally, in the fraud offending\textemdash victimization exposure multivariate models, the partial regression coefficient for low self-control is positive and statistically significant. In short, the findings demonstrate that the overlap between fraud offending and victimization exposure is partially explained by low self-control.},

For simplicity, some imputation packages assume the joint distribution of the variables in the multiple imputation model is multivariate normal, and impute the missing data from the conditional normal distribution for the missing data given the observed data. If the possibly missing data are not multivariate normal (say, binary), imputing a normal random variable can yield implausible values. To circumvent this problem, a number of methods have been developed, including rounding the imputed normal to the closest observed value in the dataset. We show that this rounding can cause biased estimates of parameters, whereas if the imputed value is not rounded, no bias would occur. This article shows that rounding should not be used indiscriminately, and thus some caution should be exercised when rounding imputed values, particularly for dichotomous variables.},

  abstract = {This article reviews school-based violence-prevention interventions published from 1993 through 1997. All of the interventions fitting the inclusion criteria involved classroom-based curricula; about one third included efforts to change the broader school environment or other settings where youth spend their time. Modest intervention effects in knowledge, attitudes, and aggressive, violent and prosocial behavior were reported. Elementary school interventions and programs focusing on the broader school environment appeared more successful in changing violence-related behavior. School-based health-promotion programs that integrated the community and home in other health areas were used to illustrate the potential success of more comprehensive interventions. A proposed framework for future comprehensive violence-prevention intervention research composed of three physical settings (school, home, and community) and three types of environments (information, social, and physical) is presented and discussed.},

Drawing from archaeology, criminology, economics, geography, history, political science, and psychology, we assemble and analyze the 60 most rigorous quantitative studies and document, for the first time, a remarkable convergence of results. We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate's influence is substantial: for each 1 standard deviation (1{$\sigma$}) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4\% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14\%. Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm 2 to 4{$\sigma$} by 2050, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.},

The research presented here applies the procedures of meta-analysis to 34 aggregate data studies reporting on violent crime, poverty, and income inequality. These studies reported a total of 76 zero-order correlation coefficients for all measures of violent crime with either poverty or income inequality. Of the 76 coefficients, all but 2, or 97 percent, were positive. Of the positive coefficients, nearly 80 percent were of at least moderate strength ({$>$}.25). It is concluded that poverty and income inequality are each associated with violent crime. The analysis, however, shows considerable variation in the estimated size of the relationships and suggests that homicide and assault may be more closely associated with poverty or income inequality than are rape and robbery.},

Rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. All three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. The major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. In conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. A summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context. The authors delineate analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of end-of-life care.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To compare the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the motor subscale of the functional independence measure (FIM), the original 10 item Barthel index (BI), and the 5 item short form BI (BI-5) in inpatients with stroke receiving rehabilitation. Methods: 118 inpatients with stroke at a rehabilitation unit participated in the study. The patients were tested with the FIM motor subscale and original BI at admission to the rehabilitation ward and before discharge from the hospital. The distribution, internal consistency, concurrent validity, and responsiveness of each measure were examined. Results: The BI and FIM motor subscale showed acceptable distribution, high internal consistency ({$\alpha$} coefficient {$\geq$} 0.84), high concurrent validity (Spearman's correlation coefficient, rs {$\geq$} 0.92, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) {$\geq$} 0.83), and high responsiveness (standardised response mean {$\geq$} 1.2, p {$<$} 0.001). The BI-5 exhibited a notable floor effect at admission but this was not found at discharge. The BI-5 showed acceptable internal consistency at admission and discharge ({$\alpha$} coefficient {$\geq$} 0.71). The concurrent validity of the BI-5 was poor to fair at admission (rs = 0.74, ICC {$\leq$} 0.55) but was good at discharge (rs {$\geq$} 0.92, ICC {$\geq$} 0.74). It is noted that the responsiveness of the BI-5 was as high as that of the BI and the FIM motor subscale. Conclusions: The results showed that the BI and FIM motor subscale had very acceptable and similar psychometric characteristics. The BI-5 appeared to have limited discriminative ability at admission, particularly for patients with severe disability; otherwise the BI-5 had very adequate psychometric properties. These results may provide information useful in the selection of activities of daily living measures for both clinicians and researchers.},

The purpose of this study was to summarize existing approaches to detect insufficient effort responding (IER) to low-stakes surveys and to comprehensively evaluate these approaches. Design/Methodology/Approach: In an experiment (Study 1) and a nonexperimental survey (Study 2), 725 undergraduates responded to a personality survey online. Findings: Study 1 examined the presentation of warnings to respondents as a means of deterrence and showed the relative effectiveness of four indices for detecting IE responses: response time, long string, psychometric antonyms, and individual reliability coefficients. Study 2 demonstrated that the detection indices measured the same underlying construct and showed the improvement of psychometric properties (item interrelatedness, facet dimensionality, and factor structure) after removing IE respondents identified by each index. Three approaches (response time, psychometric antonyms, and individual reliability) with high specificity and moderate sensitivity were recommended as candidates for future application in survey research. Implications: The identification of effective IER indices may help researchers ensure the quality of their low-stake survey data. Originality/value: This study is a first attempt to comprehensively evaluate IER detection methods using both experimental and nonexperimental designs. Results from both studies corroborated each other in suggesting the three more effective approaches. This study also provided convergent validity evidence regarding various indices for IER.

For white respondents, however, the race of the interviewer does not have a significant impact on test performance. Because most black respondents are tested by white interviewers in the GSS, the test performance of black respondents is downward biased, and the black-white test score gap is overestimated.},

The book challenges readers to foster new theoretical and practical linkages and to think beyond the traditional, and oftentimes reductionist, environmental science frame by examining issues within their turbulent political, cultural and personal landscapes. Through a variety of media and writing styles, this collection is unique in its presentation of a complex and integrated analysis of global climate change and its implications. Its companion book, Systemic Crises of Global Climate Change, addresses the social and ecological urgency surrounding climate change and the need to use intersectionality in both theory and practice. This book is a valuable resource for academics, researchers and both undergraduate and post-graduate students in the areas of Environmental Studies, Climate Change, Gender Studies and International studies as well as those seeking a more intersectional analysis of GCC.},

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine SPP and SOP as predictors of depressive diagnoses in a sample of 10- to 11-year-old children. Seven hundred and eighty-six children (390 boys, 396 girls) from primary schools in low socio-economic metropolitan areas completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS) as part of a larger study. Children who scored above the clinical cut-off for the CDI also completed part of the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents\textendash IV. Fifty children met criteria for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to predict diagnostic status from SPP, SOP, gender, and intervention group. SPP was the only significant predictor of diagnostic status. Implications for the treatment and prevention of childhood depression are discussed.},

Cognitive functions might be important to be successful in soccer. The current study investigated the relationship between cognitive functions and performance level in elite and sub-elite youth soccer players aged 13\textendash 17 years. A total of 47 elite youth soccer players (mean age 15.5 years, SD = 0.9) and 41 sub-elite youth soccer players (mean age 15.2 years, SD = 1.2) performed tasks for ``higher-level'' cognitive functions measuring working memory (i.e., Visual Memory Span), inhibitory control (i.e., Stop-Signal Task), cognitive flexibility (i.e., Trail Making Test), and metacognition (i.e., Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Design Fluency Test). ``Lower-level'' cognitive processes, i.e., reaction time and visuo-perceptual abilities, were also measured with the previous tasks. ANOVA's showed that elite players outscored sub-elite players at the ``higher-level'' cognitive tasks only, especially on metacognition (p \&lt; .05). Using stepwise discriminant analysis, 62.5\% of subjects was correctly assigned to one of the groups based on their metacognition, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility performance. Controlling for training hours and academic level, MANCOVA's showed differences in favor of the elite youth soccer players on inhibitory control ( p  = .001), and cognitive flexibility ( p  = .042), but not on metacognition ( p  = .27). No differences were found concerning working memory nor the ``lower-level'' cognitive processes (p \&gt; .05). In conclusion, elite youth soccer players have better inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and especially metacognition than their sub-elite counterparts. However, when training hours are taken into account, differences between elite and sub-elite youth soccer players remain apparent on inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility in contrast to metacognition. This highlights the need for longitudinal studies to further investigate the importance of ``higher-level'' cognitive functions for talent identification, talent development and performance in soccer.},

  abstract = {Consideration of abrupt climate change has generally been incorporated neither in analyses of climate\textendash change impacts nor in the design of climate adaptation strategies. Yet the possibility of abrupt climate change triggered by human perturbation of the climate system is used to support the position of both those who urge stronger and earlier mitigative action than is currently being contemplated and those who argue that the unknowns in the Earth system are too large to justify such early action. This paper explores the question of abrupt climate change in terms of its potential implications for society, focusing on the UK and northwest Europe in particular. The nature of abrupt climate change and the different ways in which it has been defined and perceived are examined. Using the example of the collapse of the thermohaline circulation (THC), the suggested implications for society of abrupt climate change are reviewed; previous work has been largely speculative and has generally considered the implications only from economic and ecological perspectives. Some observations about the implications from a more social and behavioural science perspective are made. If abrupt climate change simply implies changes in the occurrence or intensity of extreme weather events, or an accelerated unidirectional change in climate, the design of adaptation to climate change can proceed within the existing paradigm, with appropriate adjustments. Limits to adaptation in some sectors or regions may be reached, and the costs of appropriate adaptive behaviour may be large, but strategy can develop on the basis of a predicted long\textendash term unidirectional change in climate. It would be more challenging, however, if abrupt climate change implied a directional change in climate, as, for example, may well occur in northwest Europe following a collapse of the THC. There are two fundamental problems for society associated with such an outcome: first, the future changes in climate currently being anticipated and prepared for may reverse and, second, the probability of such a scenario occurring remains fundamentally unknown. The implications of both problems for climate policy and for decision making have not been researched. It is premature to argue therefore that abrupt climate change \textendash{} in the sense referred to here \textendash{} imposes unacceptable costs on society or the world economy, represents a catastrophic impact of climate change or constitutes a dangerous change in climate that should be avoided at all reasonable cost. We conclude by examining the implications of this contention for future research and policy formation.},

Two studies examined whether perceived weight-based discrimination and concerns over weight stigma mediated the association between BMI and self-reported psychological health (Study 1) and physical health (Study 2). Method In two online studies, adult community members completed measures of stigma-relevant mediators (perceived weight discrimination, weight stigma concerns) and provided their height and weight. In Study 1 (N = 171) participants also completed measures of psychological health (depression, self-esteem, quality of life), whereas participants in Study 2 (N = 194) also completed a measure of self-reported physical health. Process modeling was used to simultaneously test for mediation through perceived discrimination and stigma concerns independently as well as for serial mediation through both variables. Results Across both studies, we hypothesized and found support for serial mediation such that BMI was indirectly related to poorer self-reported health through its effect on perceived discrimination and concerns about stigma. Additionally, concerns about stigma mediated the association between BMI and health independent of perceived discrimination. Conclusion Weight stigma is an important mediator of the association between BMI and self-reported health. Furthermore, results indicate that concerns about facing stigma in the future mediate the link between perceived past experiences of discrimination and psychological and physical health.},

We apply this approach to the study of friendship relations among high school students from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth). We focus primarily on one particular network of 205 nodes, although we also demonstrate that this method may be applied to the largest network in the AddHealth study, with 2,209 nodes. We argue that several well-studied models in the networks literature do not fit these data well and demonstrate that the fit improves dramatically when the models include the recently developed geometrically weighted edgewise shared partner, geometrically weighted dyadic shared partner, and geometrically weighted degree network statistics. We conclude that these models capture aspects of the social structure of adolescent friendship relations not represented by previous models.},

  abstract = {Evidence from Greenland ice cores shows that year-to-year temperature variability was probably higher in some past cold periods, but there is considerable interest in determining whether global warming is increasing climate variability at present. This interest is motivated by an understanding that increased variability and resulting extreme weather conditions may be more difficult for society to adapt to than altered mean conditions. So far, however, in spite of suggestions of increased variability, there is considerable uncertainty as to whether it is occurring. Here we show that although fluctuations in annual temperature have indeed shown substantial geographical variation over the past few decades, the time-evolving standard deviation of globally averaged temperature anomalies has been stable. A feature of the changes has been a tendency for many regions of low variability to experience increases, which might contribute to the perception of increased climate volatility. The normalization of temperature anomalies creates the impression of larger relative overall increases, but our use of absolute values, which we argue is a more appropriate approach, reveals little change. Regionally, greater year-to-year changes recently occurred in much of North America and Europe. Many climate models predict that total variability will ultimately decrease under high greenhouse gas concentrations, possibly associated with reductions in sea-ice cover. Our findings contradict the view that a warming world will automatically be one of more overall climatic variation.},

They have contributed least to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) but they are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This is due to their location in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world and their low capacities to adapt to these changes. Adaptation to climate change has become an important policy priority in the international negotiations on climate change in recent years. However, it has yet to become a major policy issue within developing countries, especially the LDCs. This article focuses on two LDCs, namely Bangladesh and Mali, where progress has been made regarding identifying potential adaptation options. For example, Bangladesh already has effective disaster response systems, and strategies to deal with reduced freshwater availability, and Mali has a well-developed programme for providing agro-hydro-meteorological assistance to communities in times of drought. However, much remains to be done in terms of mainstreaming adaptation to climate change within the national policymaking processes of these countries. Policymakers need targeting and, to facilitate this, scientific research must be translated into appropriate language and timescales.},

Each of these estimators uses a smoothing parameter to control the amount of smoothing performed on a given data set. In this paper an improved version of a criterion based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), termed AICC, is derived and examined as a way to choose the smoothing parameter. Unlike plug-in methods, AICC can be used to choose smoothing parameters for any linear smoother, including local quadratic and smoothing spline estimators. The use of AICC avoids the large variability and tendency to undersmooth (compared with the actual minimizer of average squared error) seen when other `classical' approaches (such as generalized cross-validation (GCV) or the AIC) are used to choose the smoothing parameter. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the AICC-based smoothing parameter is competitive with a plug-in method (assuming that one exists) when the plug-in method works well but also performs well when the plug-in approach fails or is unavailable.},

Yet, many students still hold to the conventional wisdom that learning styles are legitimate, and may adapt their outside of class study strategies to match these learning styles. Thus, this study aims to assess if undergraduate anatomy students are more likely to utilize study strategies that align with their hypothetical learning styles (using the VARK analysis from Fleming and Mills, , Improve Acad. 11:137-155) and, if so, does this alignment correlate with their outcome in an anatomy course. Relatedly, this study examines whether students' VARK learning styles are correlated with course outcomes regardless of the students' study strategies, and whether any study strategies are correlated with course outcomes, regardless of student-specific VARK results. A total of 426 anatomy students from the 2015 and 2016 Fall semesters completed a study strategies survey and an online VARK questionnaire. Results demonstrated that most students did not report study strategies that correlated with their VARK assessment, and that student performance in anatomy was not correlated with their score in any VARK categories. Rather, some specific study strategies (irrespective of VARK results), such as use of the virtual microscope, were found to be positively correlated with final class grade. However, the alignment of these study strategies with VARK results had no correlation with anatomy course outcomes. Thus, this research provides further evidence that the conventional wisdom about learning styles should be rejected by educators and students alike.

The nonreductionist implications of the present viewpoint are discussed. It is suggested that the description employed in any psychological theory is selective because no single form of description encompasses all the distinctions discernible in the subject matter. Three rules in the use of person variables are proposed: (1) The word "cause" should be used only between person variables having the same nature; (2) identity relations occur where there are complementary descriptions of the same event; and (3) meaning attenuation is the loss of meaning that occurs when situations or behaviors are described in one way.

  abstract = {Many reports have indicated a correlation between climate and crime. Here, we examine the correlation between climatic factors and forensic autopsies, and show that higher rates of murder, manslaughter, and bodily injury resulting in death occur on sunny days than on non-sunny days. The largest number of autopsies was associated with days on which the weather was unstable. In addition to increased activity of people on sunny days, unstable and uncomfortable weather may result in crime through induction of psychiatric stress. More hit-and-run cases occurred on rainy days than on non-rainy days, and unstable weather may also be associated with traffic crimes. We conclude that weather factors, in addition to social factors, are important in murder and in fatalities due to hit-and-run traffic crimes.},

We surveyed a large number (combined N = 800) of social and personality psychologists and discovered several interesting facts. First, although only 6\% described themselves as conservative ``overall,'' there was more diversity of political opinion on economic issues and foreign policy. Second, respondents significantly underestimated the proportion of conservatives among their colleagues. Third, conservatives fear negative consequences of revealing their political beliefs to their colleagues. Finally, they are right to do so: In decisions ranging from paper reviews to hiring, many social and personality psychologists said that they would discriminate against openly conservative colleagues. The more liberal respondents were, the more they said they would discriminate.},

We examine the consequences of repeat purchasing (maintaining the status quo) versus switching in the context of information regarding the reason for the decision (e.g., prior consumption episode, brand history), and we argue that there are situations in which repeat purchasing may cause as much or even more regret than switching. We contend that this effect depends on whether or not there is a justifiable basis for the decision. In a series of four studies, we show that if there is sufficient motivation to warrant a switch, consumers will feel less regret in the face of a subsequent negative outcome realized via a switch than in one realized via a repeat purchase. Our results imply that feelings of regret are mitigated when the consumer reflects and concludes that the decision was appropriate under the circumstances.},

Seventy-eight children aged 7-12 years were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 experimental conditions. They were given either a detailed sensory description of an imminent painful event (cold-pressor arm immersion in 10 \textdegree C water) or control instructions lacking sensory information. During the cold-pressor task, half the sample received an imagery-based distraction intervention. Pain measures included immersion tolerance, self-reported pain intensity, and facial pain responses. Self-reported coping style was assessed using the Pain Coping Questionnaire [Reid, G. J., Gilbert, C. A., \& McGrath, P. J. (1998). The pain coping questionnaire: Preliminary validation. Pain, 76, 83-96]. The effects of information provision interacted with distraction for pain intensity but not pain tolerance. Children given sensory preparation reported less intense pain when this was coupled with distraction than when it was not. Children with a distraction-based coping style showed greater tolerance when assigned to a condition congruent with their coping style. These findings suggest ways to better prepare children for painful medical procedures.},

Of scientific interest is relating the two processes and developing a predictor of crashes from previous risky driving behavior. In this work, we propose two latent class models for relating risky driving behavior to the occurrence of a crash or near crash event. The first approach models the binary longitudinal crash/near crash outcome using a binary latent variable which depends on risky driving covariates and previous outcomes. A random effects model introduces heterogeneity among subjects in modeling the mean value of the latent state. The second approach extends the first model to the ordinal case where the latent state is composed of K ordinal classes. Additionally, we discuss an alternate hidden Markov model formulation. Estimation is performed using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and Monte Carlo EM. We illustrate the importance of using these latent class modeling approaches through the analysis of the teen driving behavior.},

  abstract = {Fluid intelligence (Gf) refers to the ability to reason and to solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional and educational success, especially in complex and demanding environments. Although performance on tests of Gf can be improved through direct practice on the tests themselves, there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields increased Gf in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history of research into cognitive training showing that, although performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically, transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here, we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding working memory task to measures of Gf. This transfer results even though the trained task is entirely different from the intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in Gf. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks themselves, opening a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {Background Income has been extensively studied and utilized as a determinant of health. There are several sources of income expressed as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, but there are no time series that are complete for the years between 1950 and 2015 for the 210 countries for which data exist. It is in the interest of population health research to establish a global time series that is complete from 1950 to 2015. Methods We collected GDP per capita estimates expressed in either constant US dollar terms or international dollar terms (corrected for purchasing power parity) from seven sources. We applied several stages of models, including ordinary least-squares regressions and mixed effects models, to complete each of the seven source series from 1950 to 2015. The three US dollar and four international dollar series were each averaged to produce two new GDP per capita series. Results and discussion Nine complete series from 1950 to 2015 for 210 countries are available for use. These series can serve various analytical purposes and can illustrate myriad economic trends and features. The derivation of the two new series allows for researchers to avoid any series-specific biases that may exist. The modeling approach used is flexible and will allow for yearly updating as new estimates are produced by the source series. Conclusion GDP per capita is a necessary tool in population health research, and our development and implementation of a new method has allowed for the most comprehensive known time series to date.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between suicide attempts and major public holidays in Europe.Method The analysis was based on data on 24388 suicide attempts by persons aged 15 years or older in the period 1989\textendash 1996. Data from 13 centres (representing 11 countries) participating in the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Parasuicide were analysed. The analysis of the fluctuation of suicide attempts around public holidays was based on the daily number of suicide attempts for each centre. For each day in the period under examination a mean number of suicide attempts ({$\mu$}) was calculated. The analysis was based on the assumption that the data followed a Poisson distribution. The observed number of daily suicide attempts was compared with the expected number of attempts. A multiplicative model for the expected number in each centre was developed.Results: Before Christmas there were fewer suicide attempts than expected, and after Christmas there were approximately 40\% more attempts than expected. In addition, more attempts than expected were registered on New Year's Day. In countries where people have the day off work on Whit Monday there were significantly fewer attempts during the 3 days before, but where Whit Monday is a normal working day significantly fewer attempts occurred on the Monday to Wednesday after Whit Sunday.Conclusion: There appears to be a transposition of a significant number of suicide attempts from before (and during) a major public holiday until after it. The division of holidays into non-working and working days showed that a `holiday effect' could only be found around major public holidays, particularly Christmas, Easter and Whitsun. These findings support the theory of the `broken-promise effect' for major public holidays.},

Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high.

I discuss the arbitrariness of P-values, conclusions that the null hypothesis is true, power analysis, and distinctions between statistical and biological significance. Statistical hypothesis testing, in which the null hypothesis about the properties of a population is almost always known a priori to be false, is contrasted with scientific hypothesis testing, which examines a credible null hypothesis about phenomena in nature. More meaningful alternatives are briefly outlined, including estimation and confidence intervals for determining the importance of factors, decision theory for guiding actions in the face of uncertainty, and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and other statistical practices.},

Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25\textendash 50:1, and to 100\textendash 200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.},

The verbal-perceptual model fit significantly better than the other two. We improved it by adding memory and higher-order image rotation factors. The results provide evidence for a four-stratum model with a g factor and three third-stratum factors. The model is consistent with the idea of coordination of function across brain regions and with the known importance of brain laterality in intellectual performance. We argue that this model is theoretically superior to the fluid-crystallized model and highlight the importance of image rotation in human intellectual function.},

We examine philosophical problems and sampling deficiencies that are associated with current Bayesian hypothesis testing methodology, paying particular attention to objective Bayes methodology. Because the prior densities that are used to define alternative hypotheses in many Bayesian tests assign non-negligible probability to regions of the parameter space that are consistent with null hypotheses, resulting tests provide exponential accumulation of evidence in favour of true alternative hypotheses, but only sublinear accumulation of evidence in favour of true null hypotheses. Thus, it is often impossible for such tests to provide strong evidence in favour of a true null hypothesis, even when moderately large sample sizes have been obtained. We review asymptotic convergence rates of Bayes factors in testing precise null hypotheses and propose two new classes of prior densities that ameliorate the imbalance in convergence rates that is inherited by most Bayesian tests. Using members of these classes, we obtain analytic expressions for Bayes factors in linear models and derive approximations to Bayes factors in large sample settings.},

General principles of application of measures in practice are discussed first, followed by standards to protect persons being measured and then by standards for administrative applications. Many explanations, examples, and references are provided to help professionals understand measurement principles. Improved measurement will ensure the basis of rehabilitation as a science and nourish its success as a clinical service.},

Ninety-one patients selected one of two treatments or no intervention before oral surgery (control group). One group comprised a one-session psychological treatment and included 25 patients. The second group chose oral selected midazolam and included 30 patients. Thirty-six patients chose the control group. In total, 50 patients completed the study (10 controls, 20 in the midazolam group, an d 20 in the treated group). The degree of fear was assessed by the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale. Before the operation, both interventions caused the degree of fear to fall significantly compared with the control group. Two months later, the midazolam group showed a return to baseline fear, whereas the psychologically treated group showed further imp{$<\$>$}rovement. Medium-term results after one year showed that compliance and reduction of fear remained only in the psychologically treated group.},

Given this uncertainty, when asked about climate change, it is likely that people's judgments may be affected by heuristics and accessible schemas. Three studies evaluated this proposition. Study 1 revealed a significant positive correlation between the outdoor temperature and beliefs in global warming. Study 2 showed that people were more likely to believe in global warming when they had first been primed with heat-related cognitions. Study 3 demonstrated that people were more likely to believe in global warming and more willing to pay to reduce global warming when they had first been exposed to a high vs. a low anchor for future increases in temperature. Together, results reveal that beliefs about global warming (and willingness to take actions to reduce global warming) are influenced by heuristics and accessible schemas. Several practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate whether climate change has impacted on the nature of the obsessions or compulsions experienced by patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Methods: The sample comprised 50 patients with OCD checking subtype who had presented at the Anxiety Disorders Clinic at The University of Sydney seeking treatment during the period March 2008 to November 2009. Details of the type of obsessions and compulsions directly related to climate change phenomena were identified. Results: Fourteen of the 50 participants (28\%) were identified as having OCD concerns directly related to climate change. The most frequent concerns involved electricity, water and gas wastage. Less frequent concerns included pets dying of thirst and one participant was concerned about house damage due to floors cracking, pipes leaking; roof problems and white ant activity. Compulsions included checking and rechecking pet water bowls, light switches, taps, stoves, skirting boards, pipes, roofs and wooden structures. While these behaviours are not particularly unusual for people with this condition, it was the rationale they provided for carrying them out that was surprising. Instead of checking and rechecking so as to prevent fire or flood, the rituals were specifically performed so as to reduce their global footprint, or respond to climate change-induced negative events. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the types of obsessions and compulsions experienced by 28\% of our sample were directly aligned with the current issue of climate change and the perceived dangers associated with this phenomenon. To our knowledge this represents the first documentation of the significant impact of climate change on the nature of the concerns experienced by people with OCD checking subtype. We suggest that mental health professionals need to be aware of, and assess for the presence of such concerns. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

A possible intervention is to enhance empathy in the child patient\textendash dental practitioner relationship through communication. The present paper presents a new instrument, the Survey of Anxiety and Information for Dentists (SAID), which targets children's dental anxiety, coping preferences and dental neglect, and offers children a change to request information and engage in treatment planning.MethodFive children's focus groups pilot tested the content, wording and response format of a prototype patient request form, the SAID. Participants were 34 10- to 13-year-old children who individually completed the form then discussed it item by item in their small groups.ResultsChildren had no difficulty completing most items. They identified ambiguities, and items that were meaningless to them, and proposed a new item asking the dentist about their job. Children were polarized over the response format, but they were emphatic about passing the form directly to the dentist, and not to a receptionist or assistant, stressing the importance of having a conversation with their dentist.ConclusionsBefore the pilot, dentists had expressed concerns about the potential for words in the SAID-provoking negative feelings. Children, however, wanted and needed facts, so requested that dentists use plain language, not euphemisms, to describe problems and treatment options. We report their selected practical suggestions. SAID-informed negotiated care may promote more patient cooperation and satisfaction at appointments, and more attention to oral hygiene between appointments.},

Each of the four sets of test standards were operationally defined and then compared to information and opinions about validity evidence expressed in the Mental Measurements Yearbook test reviews. Results from this process indicate that the theoretical modifications to the concept of validity have been carried over into validity practice. However, it was also found that operational modifications to the concept of validity have been influenced by validity practice. Therefore, there appears to be a symbiotic relationship between theory and practice on the influence of validity.},

Results indicated that global connectedness (i.e., connectedness combined across the domains of family, school, peers, and neighborhood) predicted well-being, but no reciprocal relation was found. However, reciprocal relations were revealed by analyses that examined connectedness at the domain level, that is, for family and school contexts. The results suggest that youth who reported higher levels of social connectedness at one point in time would subsequently report higher well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, confidence, positive affect, and aspirations).},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes data collected but not reported in the study featured in van der Linden, Leiserowitz, Feinberg, and Maibach (2015). VLFM report finding that a ``scientific consensus'' message ``increased'' experiment subjects' ``key beliefs about climate change'' and ``in turn'' their ``support for public action'' to mitigate it. However, VLFM failed to compare the responses of message-exposed subjects to those of control-group subjects exposed only to ``distractor'' news stories unrelated to climate change. After being told that ``97\% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening,'' the former did indeed increase their own estimates of ``the percentage of scientists [who] have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening.'' But the degree to which they thereafter ``increased'' their expressed levels of belief in global warming and support for mitigation did not vary significantly, in statistical or practical terms, from the degree to which the control-group subjects increased theirs. The median and modal changes in the 101-point scales used to measure these ``increases'' was in fact zero for both groups. Bayesian statistical analysis confirms the data were many times more consistent with the inference that being exposed to a consensus message had no impact on either belief in climate change or support for mitigating it than with the inference that the message had any impact on these outcomes. In addition to reporting the responses of the control-group subjects, the paper shows how the absence of an experimental effect was obscured by VLFM's use of a misspecified structural equation model. Other discrepancies between the data and VLFM's characterizations of them, including ones relating to the impact of the experimental treatment on subjects of opposing political outlooks, are also identified.},

Groups should be matched on true scores rather than observed scores, but no correction is possible for the factorial design in which groups are formed on the basis of unreliable correlated measures.

Participatory politics differ from institutional politics in that they are peer-based, interactive, and not guided by deference to traditional elites and institutions.

Core practices of civic and political engagement, such as investigation, dialogue, circulation, production, and mobilization, must be taught differently because they are now frequently enacted differently and in different contexts.

The aim of the study was to assess the seasonal variations of suicides in Lithuania throughout the years 1993-2002, describing patterns by gender, age and method of suicide.METHODS:The study material consisted of all registered suicides (n = 16,147) committed throughout 1993-2002 in Lithuania. Smoothed trends were inspected. The seasonal effect was explored using monthly ratio statistics and spectral analysis.RESULTS:Suicides in Lithuania have a distinct annual rhythm with peaks in summer and troughs in December. The December frequencies fell by more than 23\% in men and 30\% in women, while June peak reached nearly 23\% in men and July peak exceeded 29\% in women, compare with the average levels, (p {$<$} 0.05). Hanging was the most common method of suicide both in men and women comprising up to 90\% among all suicides in 1998-2002. Among different methods, only hanging suicides showed significant seasonal variations, especially in men. The seasonal amplitude has decreased over time.CONCLUSION:Substantial seasonal variations in suicides were associated with a high proportion of hanging. Extremely high suicide rates in Lithuania require further extensive studies and urgent preventive programs, taking into account the suggestions of this survey.},

  abstract = {We consider a novel paradigm for Bayesian testing of hypotheses and Bayesian model comparison. Our alternative to the traditional construction of posterior probabilities that a given hypothesis is true or that the data originates from a specific model is to consider the models under comparison as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original testing problem with an estimation one that focus on the probability weight of a given model within a mixture model. We analyze the sensitivity on the resulting posterior distribution on the weights of various prior modeling on the weights. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective is that generic improper priors are acceptable, while not putting convergence in jeopardy. Among other features, this allows for a resolution of the Lindley-Jeffreys paradox. When using a reference Beta B(a,a) prior on the mixture weights, we note that the sensitivity of the posterior estimations of the weights to the choice of a vanishes with the sample size increasing and avocate the default choice a=0.5, derived from Rousseau and Mengersen (2011). Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the classical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterior mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are quite similar.},

In Australia there have been no individual-level or cross-sectional studies of unemployment and adult crime which have failed to find a positive relationship and no time-series which have supported a positive relationship. Consistent with this pattern, a time series of homicide from 1921 to 1987 in Australia reveals no significant unemployment effect. A theoretical resolution of this apparent paradox is advanced in terms of the effect of female employment on crime in a partriarchal society. Crime is posited as a function of both total unemployment and female employment. When female employment is added to the model, it has a strong positive effect on homicide, and unemployment also assumes a strong positive effect.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of a measure designed to assess these worlds of connectedness among 320 junior high school students in Taiwan. The subscales and composite scales evidenced satisfactory reliability and concurrent validity. A hypothesized three-factor, higher order structural model of connectedness was cross-validated. Girls were generally more connected than boys. Both connectedness to school and to friends explained more variance in connectedness to self than did family connectedness. There was mixed support for separation-individuation processes. The measure appears promising in terms of future research on adolescent social development in the Asia Pacific.},

Computationally the methods have been based either on Markov chain Monte Carlo or on faster maximum a posteriori estimation. The demand for more accurate and more efficient estimation has led to the rapid emergence of workable methods, unfortunately at the expense of well-defined principles for Bayesian model building. In this article we go back to the basics and build a Bayesian multilocus association model for quantitative and binary traits with carefully defined hierarchical parameterization of Student's t and Laplace priors. In this treatment we consider alternative model structures, using indicator variables and polygenic terms. We make the most of the conjugate analysis, enabled by the hierarchical formulation of the prior densities, by deriving the fully conditional posterior densities of the parameters and using the acquired known distributions in building fast generalized expectation-maximization estimation algorithms.},

How much confidence can one have in the answers that MCMC produces? How does the use of MCMC affect the rest of the model-building process? At the Joint Statistical Meetings in August, 1996, a panel of experienced MCMC users discussed these and other issues, as well as various "tricks of the trade". This article is an edited recreation of that discussion. Its purpose is to offer advice and guidance to novice users of MCMC-and to not-so-novice users as well. Topics include building confidence in simulation results, methods for speeding and assessing convergence, estimating standard errors, identification of models for which good MCMC algorithms exist, and the current state of software development.},

The reduction at nighttime is significant over all seasons, ranging from 0.87\% in winter to 2.91\% in spring. We have explored an application where the traffic volume was used to normalise the road accident count and found the rain effect to increase by 2.4, 1.9 and 5.2\% relative to the daily, daytime and nighttime dry mean accident count. Generally, the normalised count is greater than the raw count, with a larger increase for the higher rainfall classes.},

In four questionnaire studies, we have tested the hypothesis that regrettable actions elicit a particular subcategory of these hot emotions: the self-conscious emotions (i.e., guilt, shame, embarrassment, remorse, and anger toward oneself). These studies used different methodologies and all converged to show that self-conscious emotions were the only hot emotions to be systematically greater for action regrets than for inaction regrets. A similar pattern was observed for judgments of responsibility and morality. We emphasize the theoretical and methodological implications of these results in the discussion.},

Comparative analysis revealed that the average reported rates for countries with sanctions are lower than those for countries without religious sanctions. The difference is particularly significant for females. Overall, it appears that an inverse relationship does exist; however, while countries with religious sanctions against suicide return lower rates of suicide, as recorded by the WHO, recording and reporting procedures may be affected by the existence of sanctions, thus diminishing the reliability of reported rates. Furthermore, distinctions between rates among the different denominations seem to have been somewhat blurred, in particular between Catholics and Protestants, to the extent that in certain societies Catholics have a higher reported rate of suicide\textemdash despite the fact that Catholicism is more severe in the condemnation of suicide than the majority of Protestant churches.

Two of the 11 original-replication study pairs provided sufficient statistical detail for three effects so as to permit a formal analysis of replication success. Replicating authors correctly concluded that they replicated an original effect in two cases; in the third case, my analysis suggests that the finding by the replicating authors was consistent with the original finding, contrary the conclusion of ``replication failure'' by the authors.},

The approach is based onthe application of a country-scale, integratedassessment model, called CLIMPACTS. The CLIMPACTSsystem contains a climate change scenario generator,climate and land data, and sectoral impact models. Importantly, CLIMPACTS allows time-dependentassessments of climate change and its effects, whichfacilitates the identification and examination of thresholds, which largely relate to spatial changes, over time, in regions of economic importance for these crops. However, whether such thresholds are `critical' for New Zealand cannot currently be addressed by the CLIMPACTS model. The determination of `criticality' requires a fully integrated assessment in which the social, economic, and environmental costs and risks associated with these thresholds are comprehensively evaluated.},

  abstract = {Cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and dynamical systems theory have all been proposed as frameworks for linking the diverse subdisciplines of psychology with one another, and with other scientific disciplines. Traditional cognitive science focused on content-free general processing and deemphasized motivation. An evolutionary perspective emphasizes the centrality of motivational systems and the specificity of mechanisms designed to solve particular recurrent problems. The evolutionary perspective provides a set of broad general principles linking diverse behaviors in humans as well as other species. The dynamic approach seeks even broader principles, searching for emergent patterns in all complex systems, whether animate or inanimate. Natural selection is itself one such broad principle, as is the broader principle of self-organization, which helps explain dynamic equilibria found in groups of humans and in diverse species linked together within ecosystems. Proponents of the major contending interdisciplines will need to build more bridges if the dream of a unifying paradigm is to be realized. This review samples some of the reasons why evolutionary psychologists, dynamical systems theorists, and traditional cognitive scientists need one another.},

Perceptions of scientific consensus and personal beliefs about climate change were collected over a five-month period in a student sample (N = 356). Cross-lagged panel analysis revealed that perceived scientific consensus did not prospectively predict personal agreement with the reality of climate change, thus the current study did not find support for the gateway belief model. However, the inverse pathway was significant for those with liberal voting intentions: personal beliefs about the reality of anthropogenic climate change prospectively predicted subsequent estimates of consensus. The results suggest that individuals' perceptions of a consensus among scientists do not have a strong influence on their personal beliefs about climate change.},

MethodThe association between particulate matter and suicide was determined using a time-stratified case-crossover approach in which subjects served as their own controls. All suicide cases (4,341) in 2004 that occurred in seven cities in the Republic of Korea were included. Hourly mean concentrations of particulate matter [{$\leq$}]10 \{micro\}m in aerodynamic diameter (at 106 sites in the seven cities) and particulate matter [{$\leq$}]2.5 \{micro\}m in aerodynamic diameter (at 13 sites in one city) were measured. The percent increase in suicide risk associated with an interquartile range increase in particulate matter was determined by conditional logistic regression analysis after adjusting for national holidays and meteorological factors. Subgroup analysis was performed after stratification by underlying disease (cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and psychiatric illness). ResultsThe largest associations were a 9.0\% increase (95\% CI=2.4-16.1) and a 10.1\% (95\% CI=2.0-19.0) increase in suicide risk related to an interquartile range increase in particulate matter [{$\leq$}]10 \{micro\}m (average of 0 to 2 days prior to the day of suicide) and particulate matter [{$\leq$}]2.5 \{micro\}m (1 day prior to the day of suicide), respectively. Among individuals with cardiovascular disease, a significant association between particulate matter [{$\leq$}]10 \{micro\}m (average of 0 to 2 days prior to the day of suicide) and suicide was observed (18.9\%; 95\% CI=3.2-37.0). ConclusionsA transient increase in particulate matter was associated with increased suicide risk, especially for individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease.},

Data were analyzed using a generalized additive model, adjusting for confounding factors such as sunshine, relative humidity, holidays, and long-term trends. Suicide rates were higher in spring and summer than other seasons. We observed a 1.4\% increase (95\% confidence interval = 1.0\textendash 1.7\%) in suicide with each 1 \textdegree C-increase in daily mean temperature. The suicide risks related to the temperature for males, elderly people, and those with less education were higher than for females, younger people, and those with more education, respectively. These findings have confirmed that temperature is associated with suicide in Korea and further our understanding of more susceptible groups, the effects of gender, age, and education level. Therefore, temperature, one of the meteorological factors, is an important risk factor on suicide.},

Unidimensionality was examined using a set of criteria developed for the 2-facet measurement model. Many misspecified parcel models produced admissible factor loadings despite poor overall fit and unacceptable residual covariances. The factor loadings alone may not be sufficient for evaluating latent factor representation. The findings suggest that parcels' unidimensionality should be analyzed before the measurement model to which they belong is entered into a comprehensive structural model.

At that time, however, it was hardly taken into account that chronologically ordered observations might depend on each other. The prevailing assumption was that, according to the classical linear regression model, the residuals of the estimated equations are stochastically independent from each other. For this reason, procedures were applied which are also suited for cross section or experimental data without any time dependence},

  abstract = {Limited research to date has qualitatively explored the perceptions members of the public who are not environmental activists hold of environmentalists. Therefore a qualitative survey was conducted with 89 US residents aged 21\textendash 53 (Mage = 32.74, SDage = 7.89) to obtain an in-depth understanding of how non-activists within the public perceive environmentalists. Data obtained were analyzed using thematic analysis and demonstrated that non-activist perceptions of environmentalists contained both positive and negative components. Environmentalists were seen to value nature and to be actively involved in bringing about positive environmental change (positive component), yet were also viewed as aggressive in their behaviors and stubborn in their beliefs (negative component). Further still, it was found that environmentalists were more likely to be perceived positively when they engaged in individual-level, private sphere behaviors (such as recycling), and negatively when they engaged in collective-level, public sphere behaviors (such as protesting). These findings not only challenge the assumption that members of the public typically evaluate environmentalists negatively, they also outline why some individuals may fail to identify as an environmentalist and engage in pro-environmental behavior. Furthermore, they also provide some insight as to why some environmentalists find it difficult to advocate for system change that results from collective action within the public sphere.},

  abstract = {This article reports two studies exploring the academic procrastination of 456 undergraduates. Study 1 explores the relationships among academic procrastination, self-regulation, academic self-efficacy, self-esteem, and self-efficacy for self-regulation. Results reveal that although other self-variables are related to procrastination, self-efficacy for self-regulation is most predictive of procrastination tendencies. Study 2 examines academic and motivation characteristics of ``negative procrastinators,'' the undergraduates who are most adversely influenced by procrastination. The 25\% of 195 participants in Study 2 who were classified as negative procrastinators had significantly lower GPAs, higher levels of daily and task procrastination, lower predicted and actual class grades, and lower self-efficacy for self-regulation. After controlling for GPA, daily procrastination and self-efficacy for self-regulation significantly predicted the negative impact of procrastination. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance that self-efficacy for self-regulation holds for procrastination research, and with suggestions for practitioners who work with students who are adversely affected by procrastination.},

  abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {$<$} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {$<$} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen's ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({$<$} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

While the statistical tools presented in this book are applicable to data from medicine, biology, public health, epidemiology, engineering, economics and demography, the focus here is on applications of the techniques to biology and medicine. The analysis of survival experiments is complicated by issues of censoring and truncation. The use of counting process methodology has allowed for substantial advances in the statistical theory to account for censoring and truncation in survival experiments. This book makes these complex techniques accessible to applied researchers without the advanced mathematical background. The authors present the essentials of these techniques, as well as classical techniques not based on counting processes, and apply them to data. The second edition contains some new material as well as solutions to the odd-numbered revised exercises. New material consists of a discussion of summary statistics for competing risks probabilities in Chapter 2 and the estimation process for these probabilities in Chapter 4. A new section on tests of the equality of survival curves at a fixed point in time is added in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8 an expanded discussion is presented on how to code covariates and a new section on discretizing a continuous covariate is added. A new section on Lin and Ying's additive hazards regression model is presented in Chapter 10. We now proceed to a general discussion of the usefulness of this book incorporating the new material with that of the first edition.},

  abstract = {Analyzing fear, hope, anger, and guilt in climate activism, we consider these pivotal emotions to climate activists. The way they are managed affects activists' motivations and mobilizing strategies. This argument builds on the theoretical premise that emotions energize and orient all actions. Qualitative interviews were carried out with climate activists in Denmark, Sweden, and at two UNFCCC Conferences of Youth. Our analysis shows that fear motivates action by raising awareness of the threat of climate catastrophe. The paralyzing potential of fear is mediated by hope: Hope propels action while (collective) action generates hope and manages fear. The danger-alerting capacity of fear is embraced `internally', but rejected as an effective emotion in mobilization. Instead, a hopeful `positive message' is emphasized by activists from the Global North. Anger is treated cautiously as an emotion to be pacified/transformed and guilt/blaming is largely rejected too. There is a different pattern in the southern narratives. Here hope, guilt, and anger combine to manage acute fear. Hope lies in collective action but also in the angry ascription of responsibility to the North. Contrasting the North, acute fear is thus managed by anger. Different patterns of emotion management derive from different political and socio-material contexts/experiences.},

The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic characterization of the trends in procrastination research and to suggest future directions for research and practice. The systematic characterization comprises a comparison of procrastination to functional forms of delay (referred to as strategic delay) and a presentation of the theoretical approaches to explaining procrastination. The future directions suggested pertain to the development of a differentiated understanding of procrastination and of integral interventions.

Blood samples were obtained in September, December, March, and June, and repeated in September. A significant seasonal variation in the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) was found. Men were found to have significantly lower (Bmax) values than women. Although the pattern of seasonal variation was not identical in men and women, no significant differences were detected. The affinity constant (KD) of paroxetine binding showed a significant seasonal variation. Men were found to have a significantly higher KD (lower affinity) than women. The pattern of seasonal variation was identical in men and women. These data support the evidence indicating a substantial seasonal effect on the serotonergic system, and show that in paroxetine binding studies, groups of subjects should be matched for season and gender.},

The present article reviews the empirical research on the functions of self-injury. This literature includes self-reports of reasons for self-injuring, descriptions of the phenomenology of self-injury, and laboratory studies examining the effects of self-injury proxies on affect and physiological arousal. Results from 18 studies provide converging evidence for an affect-regulation function. Research indicates that: (a) acute negative affect precedes self-injury, (b) decreased negative affect and relief are present after self-injury, (c) self-injury is most often performed with intent to alleviate negative affect, and (d) negative affect and arousal are reduced by the performance of self-injury proxies in laboratory settings. Studies also provide strong support for a self-punishment function, and modest evidence for anti-dissociation, interpersonal-influence, anti-suicide, sensation-seeking, and interpersonal boundaries functions. The conceptual and empirical relationships among the different functions remain unclear. Future research should address the measurement, co-variation, clinical correlates, and treatment implications of different functions.},

In this practice-friendly review, the authors summarize the empirical research on who self-injures, why people self-injure, and what treatments have demonstrated effectiveness. Self-injury is more common in adolescents and young adults as compared to adults. Common forms include cutting, severe scratching, burning, and banging or hitting; most individuals who self-injure have used more than one method. Although diagnostically heterogeneous, self-injurers typically exhibit two prominent characteristics: negative emotionality and self-derogation. Self-injury is most often performed to temporarily alleviate intense negative emotions, but may also serve to express self-directed anger or disgust, influence or seek help from others, end periods of dissociation or depersonalization, and help resist suicidal thoughts. Psychotherapies that emphasize emotion regulation, functional assessment, and problem solving appear to be most effective in treating self-injury. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For example, it is well known that the LSE is the best unbiased estimator under normality while it remains best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) when the normality assumption is dropped. In this paper we extend an approach given in Knautz (1993) that allows improvement of the LSE in the context of nonnormal and nonsymmetric error distributions. It will be shown that there exist linear plus quadratic (LPQ) estimators, consisting of linear and quadratic terms in the dependent variable, which dominate the LS estimator, depending on second, third and fourth moments of the error distribution. A simulation study illustrates that this remains true if the moments have to be estimated from the data. Computation of confidence intervals using bootstrap methods reveal significant improvement compared with inference based on the LS especially for nonsymmetric distributions of the error term.},

Universities are poised to play a key role in this grassroots effort by targeting their own emissions and by working with other local actors to develop climate change mitigation programmes. Researchers at the Pennsylvania State University have collaborated with university administrators and personnel to inventory campus emissions and develop mitigation strategies. In addition, they have facilitated a stakeholder-driven climate change mitigation project in one Pennsylvania county and started an ongoing service-learning project aimed at reducing emissions in another county. These campus and community outreach initiatives demonstrate that university-based mitigation action may simultaneously achieve tangible local benefits and develop solutions to broader challenges facing local climate change mitigation efforts. Outcomes include improved tools and protocols for measuring and reducing local emissions, lessons learned about service-learning approaches to climate change mitigation, and methods for creating climate change governance networks involving universities, local governments and community stakeholders.},

Research on the Freiburg mindfulness inventory (FMI) has also reflected this debate. We have investigated the psychometric properties of the FMI-14-item in an online convenience sample of n = 244 individuals (150 female; mean age 28.7 (SD = 8.76)) with (n = 75) and without (n = 169) regular meditative training). A simplified version of the beck depression inventory (BDI-V) and the trait subscale of the state-trait-anxiety-inventory (STAI-T) were used for determining criterion validity. A one-dimensional ({$\alpha$} = .83) and an alternative two-dimensional solution ({$\alpha$}F1 = .77; {$\alpha$}F2 = .69) of the FMI-14 were tested with a confirmatory factor analysis and yielded suboptimal fit indices. An exploratory analysis resulted in a reduced 8-item version of the two-dimensional solution with better fit indices, but low internal consistency ({$\alpha$}F1 = .71; {$\alpha$}F2 = .64). The factors could be identified as ``Presence'' (F1) and ``Acceptance'' (F2). Further investigation revealed that the substantial negative relationship between mindfulness and anxiety and depression is completely due to the ``Acceptance'' factor of mindfulness. This suggests that there may be heuristic value in the two-factorial solution, although for practical purposes it seems sufficient to assess mindfulness as one-dimensional construct.},

In this article, we consider psychologists' narrative approach to scientific publications as an underlying reason for this neglect and propose an incentive structure for replications within psychology. First, researchers need accessible outlets for publishing replications. To accomplish this, psychology journals could publish replication reports in files that are electronically linked to reports of the original research. Second, replications should get cited. This can be achieved by cociting replications along with original research reports. Third, replications should become a valued collaborative effort. This can be realized by incorporating replications in teaching programs and by stimulating adversarial collaborations. The proposed incentive structure for replications can be developed in a relatively simple and cost-effective manner. By promoting replications, this incentive structure may greatly enhance the dependability of psychology's knowledge base.},

Material and method The study was conducted in two healthcare facilities which serve as pandemic hospitals. 140 healthcare workers, who were employed in the COVID-19 outpatient clinics or emergency departments, participated in the present study. All participants were submitted to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Findings The number of participants without anxiety was 41(29\%), with mild anxiety was 53(38\%). Clinically significant anxiety findings were found in only 33\% of the participants. A positive correlation was found between the participants' BAI scores and PSQI, PSI scores, and a negative correlation with the WHOQOL-BREF scores. PSQI and PSI scores of nurses were statistically higher when compared to those of physicians and staff. WHOQOL-BREF scores were found to be lower. Conclusion Healthcare workers might develop psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbance. Such symptoms could adversely affect the problem-solving skills of healthcare workers and cause a deterioration in their quality of life.},

Focus groups are conducted with mothers and fathers of adolescents with ADHD who are part of a cohort study on ADHD detection and service use. Using grounded theory analysis, researchers find that parents react to external expectations put forward by various community networks, but they respond to an internalized sense of responsibility in the context of immediate family. In addition, parents' stigma management extends beyond coping with their child's disability, adding an extra layer of stressful demands that could be lessened through societal stigma reduction. To conclude, advice offered to families needs to be individualized, carefully matched with their current support networks and priorities, and needs to consider that certain stigma management approaches can perpetuate existing negative identity markers.},

This experimental study tests the impact of Protection Motivation Theory based messages on intention to reduce fossil fuel use in 3803 US adults recruited via Amazon MTurk (mean age = 36.11 years; 51.4\% female). Only messages targeting self-efficacy and response efficacy increased intention to reduce fossil fuel use relative to the control group. However, only the self-efficacy message had an impact on its corresponding construct, highlighting the importance of manipulation checks in model testing. Given the urgency of responding to climate change, the potential for additive benefits of effective messages should be considered irrespective of their underlying psychological mechanism.

This general cognitive ability is supposed to explain the positive manifold, the finding that intelligence tests with different content all correlate. Yet there is a lack of consensus regarding the psychological or neural basis of such an ability. A recent account, process-overlap theory, explains the positive manifold without proposing general intelligence. As a consequence of the theory, IQ is redefined as an emergent formative construct rather than a reflective latent trait. This implies that IQ should be interpreted as an index of specific cognitive abilities rather than the reflection of an underlying general cognitive ability.},

Passive dissemination of heat avoidance advice is likely to be ineffective given the current knowledge of high-risk groups. HHWS should be linked to the active identification and care of high-risk individuals. The systems require clear lines of responsibility for the multiple agencies involved (including the weather service, and the local health and social care agencies). Other health interventions are necessary in relation to improved housing, and the care of the elderly at home and vulnerable people in institutions. European countries need to learn from each other how to prepare for and effectively cope with heatwaves in the future.

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as ``0'' (not at all) to ``3'' (nearly every day). The PHQ-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Construct validity was assessed using the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (MHP) interview in a sample of 580 patients. RESULTS: As PHQ-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. Using the MHP reinterview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score {$\geq$}10 had a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 88\% for major depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. CONCLUSION: In addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the PHQ-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. These characteristics plus its brevity make the PHQ-9 a useful clinical and research tool.},

Method Validated two-item ultra-brief screeners for depression and anxiety were combined to constitute the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (the PHQ\textendash 4). Data were analyzed from 2,149 patients drawn from 15 primary-care clinics in the United States. Results Factor analysis confirmed two discrete factors (Depression and Anxiety) that explained 84\% of the total variance. Increasing PHQ\textendash 4 scores were strongly associated with functional impairment, disability days, and healthcare use. Anxiety had a substantial effect on functional status that was independent of depression. Conclusion The PHQ\textendash 4 is a valid ultra-brief tool for detecting both anxiety and depressive disorders.},

Serontonergic drugs affecting 5HT1 receptors, propranolol, the 5HT re-uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, and the anxiolytic oxazepam, inhibit hypothalamic attack selectively. However, hypothalamic attack is extremely unsensitive for many drugs that do affect attack provoked by natural stimuli. The pharmacology, the form, the impulsive nature, the absence of preliminaries, the insensitivity for contexts and ultimate aims of aggressive behaviour, suggest that a mechanism with the limited function of damaging adversaries of any kind is activated in the hypothalamus. This hypothalamic attack release mechanism (harm) requires specific sensory input for the expression of specific motor components, such as biting and kicking. The back and dorsal part of the opponent's head are the important attack releasing and directing stimuli. Attacks of this nature are part of the "aggressive" repertoire of the rat in natural settings. "Lateral" or "sideways" postures, specific for intermale fighting cannot be induced by hypothalamic stimulation. Drug, lesion, and stimulation studies suggest that attack and "sideways" postures are under the control of different central mechanisms. These results suggest new ways to describe the patterning of aggressive behaviour. There are interesting ethopharmacological similarities between hypothalamic responses and obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) in man. It is suggested that further study of the ethopharmacology of hypothalamic responses may shed light on the pathophysiology of impulsive behavioural symptoms which in man seem to be beyond the control of appraisal or context.},

  abstract = {Anatomical and functional studies show that the hypothalamus is at the junction of mechanisms involved in the exploratory appraisal phase of behaviour and mechanisms involved in the execution of specific consummatory acts. However, the hypothalamus is also a crucial link in endocrine regulation. In natural settings it has been shown that behavioural challenges produce large and fast increases in circulating hormones such as testosterone, prolactin, corticotropin and corticosterone. The behavioural function and neural mechanisms of such fast neuroendocrine changes are not well understood. We suggest that behaviourally specific hypothalamic mechanisms, at the cross-roads of behavioural and endocrine regulation, play a role in such neuroendocrine changes. Mild stimulation of the hypothalamic aggressive area, produces stress levels of circulating prolactin, corticotropin, and corticosterone. Surprisingly luteinizing hormone does not change. This increase in stress hormones is due to the stimulation itself, and not caused by the stress of fighting. Similar increases in corticosterone are observed during electrical stimulation of the hypothalamic self-grooming area. The corticosterone response during self-grooming-evoking stimulation is negatively correlated with the amount of self-grooming observed, suggesting that circulating corticosterone exerts a negative feedback control on grooming. Earlier literature, and preliminary data form our laboratory, show that circulating corticosterone exerts a fast positive feedback control over brain mechanisms involved in aggressive behaviour. Such findings suggest that the hormonal responses caused by the activity of behaviourally specific areas of the hypothalamus may be part of a regulation mechanism involved in facilitating or inhibiting the very behavioural responses that can be evoked from those areas. We suggest that studying such mechanisms may provide a new approach to behavioural dysfunctions associated with endocrine disorders and stress.},

These questions have been traditionally addressed by null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). NHST has deep problems that are solved by Bayesian data analysis. As psychologists transition to Bayesian data analysis, it is natural to ask how Bayesian analysis assesses null values. The article explains and evaluates two different Bayesian approaches. One method involves Bayesian model comparison (and uses Bayes factors). The second method involves Bayesian parameter estimation and assesses whether the null value falls among the most credible values. Which method to use depends on the specific question that the analyst wants to answer, but typically the estimation approach (not using Bayes factors) provides richer information than the model comparison approach.},

  abstract = {This article explains the foundational concepts of Bayesian data analysis using virtually no mathematical notation. Bayesian ideas already match your intuitions from everyday reasoning and from traditional data analysis. Simple examples of Bayesian data analysis are presented that illustrate how the information delivered by a Bayesian analysis can be directly interpreted. Bayesian approaches to null-value assessment are discussed. The article clarifies misconceptions about Bayesian methods that newcomers might have acquired elsewhere. We discuss prior distributions and explain how they are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss the relation of Bayesian data analysis to Bayesian models of mind, and we briefly discuss what methodological problems Bayesian data analysis is not meant to solve. After you have read this article, you should have a clear sense of how Bayesian data analysis works and the sort of information it delivers, and why that information is so intuitive and useful for drawing conclusions from data.},

Among frequentists in psychology, a shift of emphasis from hypothesis testing to estimation has been dubbed ``the New Statistics'' (Cumming 2014). A second conceptual distinction is between frequentist methods and Bayesian methods.

Included are step-by-step instructions on how to carry out Bayesian data analyses in the popular and free software R and WinBugs, as well as new programs in JAGS and Stan. The new programs are designed to be much easier to use than the scripts in the first edition. In particular, there are now compact high-level scripts that make it easy to run the programs on your own data sets. The book is divided into three parts and begins with the basics: models, probability, Bayes' rule, and the R programming language. The discussion then moves to the fundamentals applied to inferring a binomial probability, before concluding with chapters on the generalized linear model. Topics include metric-predicted variable on one or two groups; metric-predicted variable with one metric predictor; metric-predicted variable with multiple metric predictors; metric-predicted variable with one nominal predictor; and metric-predicted variable with multiple nominal predictors. The exercises found in the text have explicit purposes and guidelines for accomplishment.

After initial discussion of statistics and religion, the address turns to miracles, especially Hume's critique and Babbage's reply. Stress is given the often tacit or unexamined assumption of independence among witnesses of a putative miracle. Other contexts of multiple testimony are treated, and the address ends with contemporary casual assumptions of independence: nuclear reactor safety, repeated measurements, and so forth. Other topics include prayer, circularity of argument, and the tension between skepticism about testimony and the pragmatic need to accept most of it provisionally.},

The goal of the present study was to examine cerebral mechanisms underlying DD. Methods Eighteen children with DD aged 11.2 {$\pm$} 1.3 years and twenty age-matched typically achieving schoolchildren were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during trials testing approximate and exact mathematical calculation, as well as magnitude comparison. Results Children with DD showed greater inter-individual variability and had weaker activation in almost the entire neuronal network for approximate calculation including the intraparietal sulcus, and the middle and inferior frontal gyrus of both hemispheres. In particular, the left intraparietal sulcus, the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus seem to play crucial roles in correct approximate calculation, since brain activation correlated with accuracy rate in these regions. In contrast, no differences between groups could be found for exact calculation and magnitude comparison. In general, fMRI revealed similar parietal and prefrontal activation patterns in DD children compared to controls for all conditions. Conclusion In conclusion, there is evidence for a deficient recruitment of neural resources in children with DD when processing analog magnitudes of numbers.},

  abstract = {Unlike other species, humans cooperate in large, distantly related groups, a fact that has long presented a puzzle to biologists. The pathway by which adaptations for large-scale cooperation among nonkin evolved in humans remains a subject of vigorous debate. Results from theoretical analyses and agent-based simulations suggest that evolutionary dynamics need not yield homogeneous populations, but can instead generate a polymorphic population that consists of individuals who vary in their degree of cooperativeness. These results resonate with the recent increasing emphasis on the importance of individual differences in understanding and modeling behavior and dynamics in experimental games and decision problems. Here, we report the results of laboratory experiments that complement both theory and simulation results. We find that our subjects fall into three types, an individual's type is stable, and a group's cooperative outcomes can be remarkably well predicted if one knows its type composition. Reciprocal types, who contribute to the public good as a positive function of their beliefs about others' contributions, constitute the majority (63\%) of players; cooperators and free-riders are also present in our subject population. Despite substantial behavioral differences, earnings among types are statistically identical. Our results support the view that our human subject population is in a stable, polymorphic equilibrium of types.},

Community Dent Oral Epidemiol 2004; 32: 250201364. \textcopyright{} Blackwell Munksgaard, 2004Abstract~2013~Objectives:~ The aim of this meta-analytic and systematic quantitative approach is to examine the effects of behavioral interventions for dental anxiety and dental phobia.Methods:~ Eighty studies were identified where dental fear treatment with behavioral methods was evaluated. Thirty-eight of 80 met entry criteria and were included in a meta-analysis.Results:~ The calculated effect sizes (ESs) for self-reported anxiety after intervention indicate positive changes in 36 of the 38 studies and no changes in two. The overall ES~=~1.8 (95\% CI: 1.6, 1.8). The percent of subjects with post-treatment dental visits in the first 6~months post-treatment varied between 50 and 100\%. The overall ES for attendance at dental visits, weighted by sample size, is 1.4 (95\% CI: 1.3, 1.6). The homogeneity analysis indicates that the studies cannot be adequately described in one ES. The reported percentage of subjects with a dental visit between 6~months and 4~years post-treatment varied from 48 to 100\%. The overall weighted ES for visiting the dentist, adjusted for drop-outs in the studies, is 1.2 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.4).Conclusions:~ Despite extensive heterogeneity, changes in self-reported anxiety represent medium to large ESs. Patients signing up for a behavioral intervention for dental fear can be expected to report a significant reduction in their fear, and this effect generally seems to be lasting. Mean long-term attendance (\&gt;4~years after treatment) is 77\%.},

It is shown that conjoint systems analogous to the numerical composition rules advanced by the Rasch, many facet Rasch and two-parameter logistic models can be formulated using well-established axioms, representation theorems and proofs. Examples using empirical and synthetic data are presented.

It concludes that the Rasch model is not conjoint measurement as the model does not demonstrate the existence of a representation theorem between an empirical relational structure and a numerical relational structure. Psychologists seriously interested in investigating traits for quantitative structure should use the theory of conjoint measurement itself rather than the Rasch model. This is not to say, however, that empirical relationships between conjoint measurement and the Rasch model are precluded. The paper concludes by suggesting some relevant research avenues.},

This prospective randomized controlled study compares a brief relaxation method (BR) with music distraction (MD) and with a control group (C). The authors randomly assigned 90 patients with dental anxiety to BR, MD or C groups. They assessed the outcomes by means of the state anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results. Both BR and MD reduced dental anxiety significantly. In contrast, patients in the C group did not exhibit a significant change in their anxiety level. BR was significantly superior to MD. Stratification according to the patient's general level of dental anxiety revealed that BR also was particularly effective in highly anxious subjects, whereas MD did not have a clinically relevant effect on these subjects. Conclusions. BR appears to be a safe, economically sound and effective nonpharmacological approach to the short-term reduction of dental anxiety. Additional investigations are needed to validate these findings in a larger clinical trial and to determine the long-term effects of this intervention. Clinical Implications. Relaxation techniques are a pragmatic, effective and cost-saving method of facilitating dental treatment in anxious patients.},

When all measured variables were entered together into a regression model, intelligence was still the strongest predictor of GPA, being followed by Agreeableness in Grades 2 to 4 and Conscientiousness in Grades 6 to 12. Interactions between predictor variables and age accounted for only a small percentage of variance in GPA, suggesting that academic achievement relies basically on the same mechanisms through the school years.},

Drawing on analogies between genetic and cultural processes, mathematically sophisticated biologists have used population genetics models as the basis for the development of analogous models of cultural transmission, cultural evolution and gene-culture co-evolution. These models are designed to describe and analyse the diffusion of cultural traits through populations, under the influence of various cultural and evolutionary forces. They have already been applied to address many problems of interest to psychologists. Here I present an introduction to these models, explaining the mathematics in simple terms, and giving examples of the work of leading theorists. I go on to discuss the findings of most relevance to psychology, critically analysing the most important conclusions. Finally, I suggest some areas of psychology in which these models might usefully be applied. I argue that these models constitute a major theoretical innovation, and that there is considerable potential for their application in psychology.},

Moreover, the rate of production of serotonin by the brain was directly related to the prevailing duration of bright sunlight (r=0{$\cdot$}294, p=0{$\cdot$}010), and rose rapidly with increased luminosity.

Given that both endogenous depression severity and the incidence of suicide peak during the spring and summer months, it would seem that an environmental cue--one that generates alterations in brain neuronal activity that result in depressed affect or suicidal ideation--might be important. METHOD: The authors examined the frequency of suicide and its relation to meteorological factors in the state of Victoria between January 1990 and April 1999. RESULTS: The incidence of suicide had its nadir in winter and zenith in the spring and summer and paralleled closely the number of bright sunlight hours. This pattern was particularly marked for violent suicide. During the decade, the suicide rate significantly increased among men between 21 and 60 years of age and women between 41 and 60. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of suicide in southeastern Australia displays a clear seasonal pattern, being positively linked with prevailing levels of sunlight. The rate of suicide increased in the latter half of the last decade.},

However, much of the research in this field is atheoretical and the findings are inconsistent and contradictory. The present study investigated the seasonality of homicide and robbery in Israel from 1977 to 1985. The authors' analysis was informed by the routine activity approach, which views crime as a function of three main elements: motivated offenders, suitable targets, and absence of guardians. Based on this approach and on the differences between homicide and robbery (with regard to motivation, victim-offender relationships, and planning), the authors hypothesized that robbery would show a seasonal trend and would peak during the winter (November through March) due to the increase in the cost of living and the facilitating environmental conditions during these months. In contrast, they expected homicide to be most prevalent in August (when social interaction is at its highest level), and that it would not follow a distinct seasonal pattern because victim availability and suitability, as well as the variety of motives involved in homicide, make this crime much less dependent on climatic conditions. The data were analyzed by three statistical methods: a stochastic model (SARIMA), a X - 11 seasonal adjustment, and a rank order of the three highest months. The results generally supported the hypotheses indicating the utility of the routine activity approach as a useful framework for analyzing the seasonality of crime. The methodological implications of using different definitions and measures of seasonality are discussed, and suggestions are put forward for further study in this field.},

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

  abstract = {In their research on decision under uncertainty, Kahneman and Tversky (1982a) examined whether, given the same negative outcome, there is any difference in the experience of regret, depending on whether the outcome follows action or inaction. This study attempted to replicate Kahneman and Tversky's (1982a) finding of greater regret for action than inaction and to determine whether this pattern extends to the parallel case of joy over happy outcomes, to different life domains, and to both genders. Through a vignette experiment, the previousfinding of a strong tendency to imagine greater regret following action than inaction was replicated. The same pattern was observed in the case of joy over positive outcomes. In two of the three vignettes presented, this "actor effect "was stronger for negative than for positive outcomes. In a third vignette, explicit knowledge of a missed negative outcome seems to have magnified the usual joy over having made a good decision, causing the expected joy over acting and succeeding to rise to the typically high level of regret over acting and failing. Suggestions regarding the future study of these issues are offered.},

This form was based on an earlier version of the scale containing parallel forms A and B. Procrastination was positively related to measures of disorganization and independent of need-achievement, energy level, and self-esteem. High scorers on the procrastination scale were more likely to return their completed inventory late. Procrastination was unrelated to grade-point average (R = -10). In Study II, subjects completed Form G of the procrastination scale and a variation of Little's (1983) Personal Projects Questionnaire. Based on ratings of their personal projects, procrastinators and nonprocrastinators were distinguished in a number of ways, foremost being the nonprocrastinator's more positive response to the project dimension of stress and the procrastinator's greater sensitivity to how enjoyable the project was in terms of time spent. In Study III, after completing a personality inventory, air-passengers awaiting their flight departure were asked to take an envelope with them and to mail it back on a designated date. Procrastinators were less accurate in doing so than were nonprocrastinators. Various aspects of procrastinatory behavior were discussed, including a reconsideration of the defining of the construct.},

Data were analyzed using multiple regression. Consistent with previous research, authoritarianism was a significant and strong positive predictor of both forms of prejudice. With authoritarianism statistically controlled, however, fundamentalism emerged as a significant negative predictor of racial prejudice but a positive predictor of homosexual prejudice. In a second study, we conducted parallel multiple regressions using the correlations from two previously published studies. The Study 1 results were replicated exactly, except that fundamentalism was a nonsignificant predictor of homosexual prejudice. We interpret the results as evidence that Christian fundamentalism consists of a second major component other than authoritarianism--related to Christian belief content--that is inversely related to some forms of prejudice (including racial prejudice) but not others (e.g., homosexual prejudice).},

As predicted, participants' greater regret for errors of omission (vs. commission) in the distant term (vs. near term) was mediated by level of abstraction.

  abstract = {We investigated the way experienced users interpret Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) outcomes. An empirical study was designed to compare the reactions of two populations of NHST users, psychological researchers and professional applied statisticians, when faced with contradictory situations. The subjects were presented with the results of an experiment designed to test the efficacy of a drug by comparing two groups (treatment/placebo). Four situations were constructed by combining the outcome of the t test (significant vs. nonsignificant) and the observed difference between the two means D (large vs. small). Two of these situations appeared as conflicting (t significant/D small and t nonsignificant/D large). Three fundamental aspects of statistical inference of statistical inference were investigated by means of open questions: drawing inductive conclusions about the magnitude of the true difference from the data in hand, making predictions for future data, and making decisions about stopping the experiment. The subjects were 25 statisticians from pharmaceutical companies in France, subjects well versed in statistics, and 20 psychological researchers from various laboratories in France, all with experience in processing and analyzing experimental data. On the whole, statisticians and psychologists reacted in a similar way and were very impressed by significant results. It must be outlined that professional applied statisticians were not immune to misinterpretations, especially in the case of nonsignificance. However, the interpretations that accustomed users attach to the outcome of NHST can vary from one individual to another, and it is hard to conceive that there could be a consensus in the face of seemingly conflicting situations. In fact, beyond the superficial report of "erroneous" interpretations, it can be seen in the misuses of NHST intuitive judgmental "adjustments" that try to overcome its inherent shortcomings. These findings encourage the many recent attempts to improve the habitual ways of analyzing and reporting experimental data. Nous avons \'etudi\'e la mani\`ere dont des utilisateurs exp\'eriment\'es interpr\`etent les r\'esultats des Tests de Signification de l'Hypoth\`ese Nulle. Une \'etude empirique a \'et\'e men\'ee pour comparer les r\'eactions de deux populations d'utilisateurs, des chercheurs en psychologie et des statisticiens professionnels, face \`a des situations conflictuelles. On pr\'esentait aux sujets les r\'esultats d'une exp\'erience planifi\'ee pour tester l'efficacit\'e d'un m\'edicament en comparant deux groupes (traitement/ placebo). Quatre situations \'etaient construites en combinant l'issue du test t (significatif vs. non-significatif) et la diff\'erence observ\'ee D entre les deux moyennes (grande vs. petite). Deux de ces situations apparaissaient conflictuelles (t significatif/ D petite et t non-significatif/D grande). Trois aspects fondamentaux de l'inf\'erence statistique \'etaient examin\'es au moyen de questions ouvertes: tirer une conclusion inductive sur la grandeur de la vraie diff\'erence, faire une pr\'ediction relative \`a des donn\'ees futures et prendre une d\'ecision sur l'arr\^et de l'exp\'erience. Les sujets \'etaient 25 statisticiens de l'industrie pharmaceutique en France, donc experts en statistique, et 20 chercheurs en psychologie de diff\'erents laboratoires fran\c{c}ais, ayant tous une exp\'erience de l'analyse des donn\'ees exp\'erimentales. Dans l'ensemble, les statisticiens et les psychologues se sont comport\'es d'une mani\`ere similaire et ont \'et\'e tr\`es influenc\'es par les r\'esultats significatifs. Un r\'esultat important est que les statisticiens ne sont pas \`a l'abri des abus d'interpr\'etation des tests, en particulier quand le r\'esultat est non significatif. Cependant l'interpr\'etation des tests peut varier consid\'erablement d'un individu \`a l'autre et est loin de donner lieu \`a un consensus face \`a des situations en apparence conflictuelles. En fait, au del\`a du constat superficiel de l'existence d'interpr\'etations "erron\'ees", on peut voir dans les m\'esusages des tests des "ajustements" de jugement intuitifs, pour tenter de surmonter leurs insuffisances fondamentales. Ces r\'esultats encouragent les nombreuses tentatives r\'ecentes d'am\'eliorer les proc\'edures habituelles pour analyser les donn\'ees exp\'erimentales et pr\'esenter les r\'esultats. Investigamos la manera en la que usuarios experimentados interpretan los resultados de las Pruebas de Significacia de la Hip\'otesis Nula (PSHN). Se dise\~n\'o un estudio emp\'irico para comparar las reacciones de dos poblaciones de usuarios de las PSHN, psic\'ologos investigadores y profesionales de la estad\'istica aplicada, enfrentados a situaciones contradictorias. Los participantes del estudio se enfrentaron a los resultados de un experimento dise\~nado para someter a prueba la eficacia de un f\'armaco en el que se comparaban dos grupos (tratamiento/placebo). Se construyeron cuatro situaciones en las que se combinaba el resultado de la aplicaci\'on de la prueba t(significativo vs no significativo) y las diferencias observadas entre las dos medias d (grandes o peque\~nas). Estas dos situaciones eran conflictivas (t significativa/ D peque\~na, y t no significativa / D grande). Se investig\'o tres aspectos fundamentales de la inferencia estad\'istica por medio de preguntas abiertas: derivaci\'on de conclusiones inductivas sobre la magnitud de la diferencia verdadera de los datos disponibles, realizaci\'on de predicciones para datos futuros, y toma de decisiones sobre si dar por terminado el experimento. Los participantes fueron 25 profesionales de la estad\'istica de compa\~n\'ias farmac\'euticas en Francia, versados en estad\'istica, y 20 psic\'ologos investigadores con experiencia en el procesamiento y an\'alisis de datos experimentales. En total, los estad\'isticos y los psic\'ologos respondieron de manera similar y se mostraron impresionados por el hecho de que los resultados fuesen sugnificativos. Debe subrayarse que los profesionales de la estad\'isticas no eran inmunes a las malas interpretaciones, especialmente en el caso de la no significancia. No obstante, las interpretaciones que los usuarios habituados adjudican al resultado de las PSHN pueden variar de un individuo a otro, y es dif\'icil concebir que hubiera consenso frente a situaciones ostensiblemente conflictivas. De hecho, m\'as all\'a del informe superficial de las interpretaciones "err\'oneas", puede apreciarse el mal uso de los "ajustes" en el juicio intuitivo de las PSHN que intenta corregir sus limitaciones inherentes. Estos hallazgos promueven los muchos intentos recientes por mejorar las formas habituales de analizar e informar sobre los datos experimentales.},

  abstract = {Background Despite continuing vaccine controversies, little is known about the trajectory of change in vaccine confidence over time. The current study examined whether there are subpopulations among the New Zealand public with diverging trajectories of confidence in the safety of childhood vaccinations from 2013 to 2017. Methods Using longitudinal survey data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, latent class growth models identified subpopulations with distinct rates and directions of change in vaccine confidence from 2013 to 2017 (N= 12,423; 11,912; 12,009; 10,254). The demographic profiles of these subpopulations were examined. Findings Most New Zealanders' (60\%) maintained strong vaccine confidence throughout the years (i.e. vaccine believers), but 30\% expressed decreasing confidence over time (i.e. vaccine skeptics). Around 10\% were former skeptics who had low vaccine confidence in 2013 but showed increasing confidence thereafter. Men, Europeans/Others, those more educated and living in more affluent regions were more likely to be vaccine believers. Relative to former skeptics, women, older individuals and those with lower education were more likely to be vaccine skeptics. Interpretation Attitudes toward the safety of childhood vaccinations are becoming increasingly polarized in New Zealand. Roughly 30\% of the population are becoming more concerned about vaccine safety over time, 10\% are becoming more confident, whereas 60\% show consistent high vaccine confidence. It is vital to further investigate the key contributors to decreasing confidence among vaccine skeptics and implement target interventions.

A spring peak of suicide was observed, and associations between various climatic parameters and suicide have been suggested. This study sets out to verify seasonal patterns of suicide rates and to explore the association with climate in Taiwan.Method The study used a nationwide mortality database in Taiwan from January 1997 to December 2003. An autoregressive integrated moving average model was applied to examine the presence of seasonality and the association of climate with suicidal death.Results Seasonality with a spring peak was evident in suicidal death regardless of gender or age. Ambient temperature was positively associated with suicide after adjustment for trend and seasonality.Limitations Misclassification and underreporting of suicidal death in the registry system might confound the results. Ecological fallacies might exist.Conclusions The seasonal effect on suicide is significant in Taiwan. Suicide rates may be influenced by ambient temperatures. The findings are of research interest for future studies regarding mechanisms of suicidal behavior, and also of practical interest for better timing of suicide interventions and effective preventive strategies.},

The pandemic of the disease is a tragedy, which may leave a catastrophic psychological imprint on nurses. Understanding nurses' mental distress can help when implementing interventions to mitigate psychological injuries to nurses. Aims and objectives To quantify the severity of nurses' post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and stress and explore the influencing factors of their psychological health when caring for patients with COVID-19. Design A cross-sectional survey. Methods The PTSD Checklist-Civilian and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered from 11 to 18 March 2020, to 90 nurses selected from another city to go and help an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, China. These nurses were selected because of their high levels of clinical performance and resilience status. Results Nurses' average PTSD score was 24.62 {$\pm$} 6.68, and five (5.6\%) of the nurses reported a clinically significant level of PTSD symptoms ({$>$}38 points). Nurses' perceived stress averaged 19.33 {$\pm$} 7, and 20 nurses (22.22\%) scored positively {$>$}25 points. Nurses' stress and PTSD symptoms were positively correlated (P {$<$} .01). Major stress sources included working in an isolated environment, concerns about personal protective equipment shortage and usage, physical and emotional exhaustion, intensive workload, fear of being infected, and insufficient work experiences with COVID-19. Conclusions This study showed that even relatively highly resilient nurses experienced some degree of mental distress, including PTSD symptoms and perceived stress. Our findings highlight the importance of helping nurses cultivate resilience and reduce stress. Relevance to clinical practice Recommendations for practice include providing adequate training and orientation before assigning nurses to ICU to help, offering disaster-emergency-preparedness training to keep nurses prepared, providing caring and authentic nursing leadership, offering ongoing psychological support to frontline nurses.},

  abstract = {Chronic unemployment, deindustrialized cities, and mass incarceration are among the grievous social problems that will not yield unless American citizens address them.  Peter Levine's We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For is a primer for anyone motivated to help revive our fragile civic life and restore citizens' public role. After offering a novel theory of active citizenship, a diagnosis of its decline, and a searing critique of our political institutions, Levine-one of America's most influential civic engagement activists-argues that American citizens must address our most challenging issues. People can change the norms and structures of their own communities through deliberative civic action. He illustrates rich and effective civic work by drawing lessons from YouthBuild USA, Everyday Democracy, the Industrial Areas Foundation, and many other civic groups. Their organizers invite all citizens-including traditionally marginalized people, such as low-income teenagers-to address community problems. Levine explores successful efforts from communities across America as well as from democracies overseas. He shows how cities like Bridgeport, CT and Allentown, PA have bounced back from the devastating loss of manufacturing jobs by drawing on robust civic networks. The next step is for the participants in these local efforts to change policies that frustrate civic engagement nationally.  Filled with trenchant analysis and strategies for reform, We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For analyzes and advocates a new citizen-centered politics capable of tackling problems that cannot be fixed in any other way.},

We summarize how people respond to corrections of misinformation, and what kinds of corrections are most effective. We argue that to be effective, scientific research into misinformation must be considered within a larger political, technological, and societal context. The post-truth world emerged as a result of societal mega-trends such as a decline in social capital, growing economic inequality, increased polarization, declining trust in science, and an increasingly fractionated media landscape. We suggest that responses to this malaise must involve technological solutions incorporating psychological principles, an interdisciplinary approach that we describe as ``technocognition.'' We outline a number of recommendations to counter misinformation in a post-truth world.},

Internet blogs in particular have become the staging ground for conspiracy theories that challenge the link between HIV and AIDS, the benefits of vaccinations, or the reality of climate change. A recent study involving visitors to climate blogs found that conspiracist ideation was associated with the rejection of climate science and other scientific propositions such as the link between lung cancer and smoking, and between HIV and AIDS. That article stimulated considerable discursive activity in the climate blogosphere\textemdash i.e., the numerous blogs dedicated to climate ``skepticism''\textemdash that was critical of the study. The blogosphere discourse was ideally suited for analysis because its focus was clearly circumscribed, it had a well-defined onset, and it largely discontinued after several months. We identify and classify the hypotheses that questioned the validity of the paper's conclusions using well-established criteria for conspiracist ideation. In two behavioral studies involving naive participants we show that those criteria and classifications were reconstructed in a blind test. Our findings extend a growing body of literature that has examined the important, but not always constructive, role of the blogosphere in public and scientific discourse.},

  abstract = {Background Among American Conservatives, but not Liberals, trust in science has been declining since the 1970's. Climate science has become particularly polarized, with Conservatives being more likely than Liberals to reject the notion that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the globe. Conversely, opposition to genetically-modified (GM) foods and vaccinations is often ascribed to the political Left although reliable data are lacking. There are also growing indications that rejection of science is suffused by conspiracist ideation, that is the general tendency to endorse conspiracy theories including the specific beliefs that inconvenient scientific findings constitute a ``hoax.''  Methodology/Principal findings We conducted a propensity weighted internet-panel survey of the U.S. population and show that conservatism and free-market worldview strongly predict rejection of climate science, in contrast to their weaker and opposing effects on acceptance of vaccinations. The two worldview variables do not predict opposition to GM. Conspiracist ideation, by contrast, predicts rejection of all three scientific propositions, albeit to greatly varying extents. Greater endorsement of a diverse set of conspiracy theories predicts opposition to GM foods, vaccinations, and climate science.  Conclusions Free-market worldviews are an important predictor of the rejection of scientific findings that have potential regulatory implications, such as climate science, but not necessarily of other scientific issues. Conspiracist ideation, by contrast, is associated with the rejection of all scientific propositions tested. We highlight the manifold cognitive reasons why conspiracist ideation would stand in opposition to the scientific method. The involvement of conspiracist ideation in the rejection of science has implications for science communicators.},

Sea-defences are of little use (and may not be feasible at all) against the damage caused by tropical cyclones and some sea-surges.

Operationalizing the construct of mindfulness is important in order to determine mechanisms of therapeutic change elicited by mindfulness practice. In addition to existing state and trait measures of mindfulness, process measures are needed to assess the ways in which individuals apply mindfulness in the context of their practice. Method This report details three independent studies (qualitative interview, N = 8; scale validation, N = 134; and replication study, N = 180) and the mixed qualitative\textendash quantitative methodology used to develop and validate the Applied Mindfulness Process Scale (AMPS), a 15-item process measure designed to quantify how mindfulness practitioners actively use mindfulness to remediate psychological suffering in their daily lives. Results In Study 1, cognitive interviewing yielded a readily comprehensible and accessible scale of 15 items. In Study 2, exploratory factor analysis derived a potential three-factor solution: decentering, positive emotion regulation, and negative emotion regulation. In Study 3, confirmatory factor analysis verified better model fit with the three-factor structure over the one-factor structure. Conclusions AMPS functions as a measure to quantify the application of mindfulness and processes of change in the context of MBIs and general mindfulness practice.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems \textemdash{} false alarms, misses, and inversions \textemdash{} for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

Strengthening the dykes to become `unbreachable' (Delta dykes) may effectively reduce the flooding risks and sensitivity to climate change. Freeing up more fresh water is possible by making adjustments to the New Waterway, where 80\% of the Rhine is discharged into the sea, also in extremely dry situations. In this way, fresh water shortages due to climate change may be prevented.},

  abstract = {Objectives The objective of this study was to assess the relation between temperature and suicide mortality in Japan using time series analysis with a semiparametric approach. Methods We analyzed the relation between daily fluctuations in suicide mortality and maximum temperatures for all regions in Japan over the period of time from 1972 to 1995 using a generalized additive model. The model controls for the time trend, season, selected meteorological parameters, day of the week, and holiday. Adjustment was based using penalized splines and the decision on the amount of smoothness was based on minimizing the unbiased risk estimation criterion. Results The results show that suicide mortality in Japan has a seasonal character and it varies from year to year, with the highest occurrence in April, as well as in the first part of the week, especially on Mondays and Tuesdays. As for the day of the week, there were only few suicide cases on Saturdays and holidays. We found that for all regions in Japan when temperature increased the suicide mortality increased on the same day (lag = 0). Analysis by method of suicide showed that when temperature increased mortality significantly increased only for suicide by a violent method. The pattern of the relation for other methods remained unclear. Conclusions This study suggests that an increase in temperature has a short-term effect on suicide mortality in Japan.},

I critically evaluate and update earlier conclusions regarding deterioration effects in psychotherapy, outline methodological obstacles standing in the way of identifying potentially harmful therapies (PHTs), provide a provisional list of PHTs, discuss the implications of PHTs for clinical science and practice, and delineate fruitful areas for further research on PHTs. A heightened emphasis on PHTs should narrow the scientist-practitioner gap and safeguard mental health consumers against harm. Moreover, the literature on PHTs may provide insight into underlying mechanisms of change that cut across many domains of psychotherapy. The field of psychology should prioritize its efforts toward identifying PHTs and place greater emphasis on potentially dangerous than on empirically supported therapies.},

Respondents who thought that day was warmer than usual believed more in and had greater concern about global warming than did respondents who thought that day was colder than usual.

Reciprocally, both extracellular concentration of 5-HT in the hypothalamus and Tco were decreased with a dialysis solution containing tetrodotoxin (which blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channel), zero calcium concentration, or systemic administration of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 5-HT1A agonist). Intrahypothalamic administration of 8-OH-DPAT and (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (a 5-HT2 agonist) produced hypothermic and hyperthermic effects, respectively. The results indicate that elevating the 5-HT levels in the hypothalamus activates postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors and results in hyperthermic effects, whereas stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the hypothalamus reduces the endogenous 5-HT release and results in hypothermic effects.},

  abstract = {Rationale Seasonal influenza vaccination rates are below the recommended targets, contributing to significant preventable harms. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), a widely applied model of motivation to respond to threats, may provide some insights into strategies to increase the rate of vaccine uptake. Yet, previous research has omitted some of the proposed predictors of intention when applying this model to vaccination. Objective The aim of the study is to assess the utility of the PMT in predicting intention to obtain the seasonal influenza vaccine. This study will be the first to examine the role of all six PMT constructs in predicting intention to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. Method A cross-sectional study of 547 US residents was conducted using Amazon MTurk. Results All constructs show significant bivariate correlations in the direction expected from the prior literature. Further examination of the theory within a linear regression model, however, found that perceived costs of vaccinating (i.e., response costs) did not uniquely account for variance in intention. All other components, perceived severity of and susceptibility to influenza, the perceived benefits of not vaccinating (i.e., maladaptive response rewards), the self-efficacy to vaccinate, and the perceived efficacy of vaccinating in preventing influenza (i.e., response efficacy) were unique predictors of intention. Overall, the PMT accounted for 62\% of the variance in intention to vaccinate. Conclusions The study is the first to investigate influenza vaccination using all six theorised predictors of intention from the PMT. The findings highlight the importance of the simultaneous inclusion of all components of the model in assessing their potential utility as targets for intervention. Importantly, the results identify under-utilised constructs in the promotion of vaccine uptake, such as maladaptive response rewards, which should be considered targets for future intervention.},

  abstract = {Validity is widely held to be the most important criterion for an assessment. Nevertheless, assessment professionals have disagreed about the meaning of validity almost from the introduction of the term as applied to testing about 100 years ago. Over the years, the best and brightest people in assessment have contributed their thinking to this problem and the fact that they have not agreed is testimony to the complexity and importance of validity. Even today, ways to define validity are being debated in the published literature in the assessment profession. How can such a fundamental concept be so controversial?This book brings focus to diverse perspectives about validity. Its chapter authors were chosen because of their expertise and because they differ from each other in the ways they think about the validity construct. Its introduction and ten chapters bridge both the theoretical and the practical. Contributors include most prominent names in the field of validity and their perspectives are at once cogent and controversial. From these diverse and well-informed discussions, the reader will gain a deep understanding of the core issues in validity along with directions toward possible resolutions. The debate that exists among these authors is a rich one that will stimulate the reader's own understanding and opinion.Several chapters are oriented more practically. Ways to study validity are presented by professionals who blend current assessment practice with new suggestions for what sort of evidence to develop and how to generate the needed information. In addition they provide examples of some of the options on how to present the validity argument in the most effective ways.The initial chapter by the Editor is an effort to orient the reader as well as providing an overview of the book. Bob Lissitz has provided a brief perspective on each of the subsequent chapters as well as presenting a series of questions regarding validation that the reader will want to try to answer for themselves, as he or she reads through this book.This book's topic is fundamental to assessment, its authors are distinguished, and its scope is broad. It deserves to become established as a fundamental reference on validity for years to come.},

They also consider whether the perspective on the test examination is theoretical or practical. The resulting taxonomy, encompassing both investigative focus and perspective, serves to organize a reconceptualization of the field of validity studies. The authors argue that this approach, together with changes in the rest of the terminology regarding validity, leads to a more understandable and usable model.},

  abstract = {Despite the decline in the incidence of dental caries in the United States over the past several years, the condition remains a significant problem for the nation's poor children. Efforts to identify the factors responsible for caries development in samples of children of low socioeconomic status have primarily focused on a limited number of variables, and those have been predominantly biological (mutans streptococci, for example). Resulting models of caries development have usually shown good sensitivity but poor specificity. They have had limited implications for treatment. In an effort to produce a comprehensive model of caries development, 184 low-income preschool children were clinically assessed for mutans streptococci and for decayed, missing, or filled surfaces of deciduous teeth twice, first at age 4 years (baseline) and again a year later (year 1 assessment). As the clinical assessments were being done, caretakers were being interviewed to obtain data from five domains: demographics, social status, dental health behaviors, cognitive factors such as self-efficacy (self-confidence) and controllability, and perceived life stress. Data were analyzed using a structural equations modeling approach in which variables from all domains, plus baseline decayed missing and filled surfaces and baseline mutants, were used together to create a model of caries development in the year 1 assessment. Results confirmed earlier work that suggested that caries development at a 1-year followup was strongly dependent on earlier caries development. Early caries development in this sample was determined in part by mutans levels and by dental health behaviors. These behaviors themselves were accounted for partly by a cognitive factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This is an important gap because coefficient \{alpha\} is the most widely used measurement statistic in all of the social, educational, and health sciences. The impact of outliers on coefficient \{alpha\} is investigated for varying values of population reliability and sample sizes for visual analogue scales. Results show that coefficient \{alpha\} is not affected by symmetric outlier contamination, whereas asymmetric outliers artificially inflate the estimates of coefficient \{alpha\}. Coefficient \{alpha\} estimates are upwardly biased and more variable sample to sample, with increasing asymmetry and proportion of outlier contamination in the population. However, these effects of outliers on the bias and sample variability of coefficient \{alpha\} estimates are reduced for increasing population reliability. The results are discussed in the context of providing guidance for computing or interpreting coefficient \{alpha\} for visual analogue scales.},

Previous studies suggest that the SPQ-B either has a three- or four-factor structure, but the majority of studies have been conducted in Western contexts and little is known about the psychometric properties of the scale in other populations. In this study factorial invariance testing across three cultural contexts\textendash Australia, China and Chile was conducted. In total, 729 young adults (Mean age = 23.99 years, SD = 9.87 years) participated. Invariance testing did not support the four-factor model across three countries. Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed that neither the four- nor three-factor model had strong fit in any of the settings. However, in comparison with other competing models, the four-factor model showed the best for the Australian sample, while the three-factor model was the most reasonable for both Chinese and Chilean samples. The reliability of the SPQ-B scores, estimated with Omega, ranged from 0.86 to 0.91. These findings suggest that the SPQ-B factors are not consistent across different cultural groups. We suggest that these differences could be attributed to potential confounding cultural and translation issues.},

The mean score on the DAS was 7.8, and 8.4\% of subjects were classified as dentally anxious. There were no differences in mean DAS scores by sex but significant differences by age, with younger individuals having higher scores (P \&lt; 0.0001). The edentulous had significantly higher scores than the dentate (P \&lt; 0.001). Scores on the SIADF scale were higher among younger individuals (P \&lt; 0.0001), the edentulous (P \&lt; 0.01) and women (P \&lt; 0.05). Older adults who were dentally anxious were less likely to report a regular source of dental care and a dental visit in the previous year and more likely to report having avoided or delayed dental treatment. Possible explanations of higher dental anxiety scores among younger persons and the edentulous are reviewed.},

The studies that are available used limited samples from which it is not possible to generalise, or confined their enquiries to painful experiences only. In this paper data are provided on negative dental experiences and their relationship to dental anxiety obtained from a large, random sample of the general population. Just over three-quarters reported what are termed as direct negative experiences; 71 per cent had had experiences that were painful, 23 per cent experiences that were frightening and 9 per cent experiences that were embarrassing. Such experiences were not confined to childhood. For 23 per cent, the first experience of this kind happened during adolescence and for 40 per cent in adulthood. The relationship between these experiences and dental anxiety was strong. Subjects reporting all three types of experience were 22.4 times at risk of being dentally anxious than subjects reporting none of them. The data suggested that the nature of these unpleasant experiences was more important than the age at which they occurred in predicting dental anxiety. One third of dentally anxious subjects reported a negative response experience in the form of feeling faint, fainting or having a panic attack while at the dentist. Further research using more appropriate methods is needed to clarify the role of dental experiences in the genesis of dental anxiety.},

Both questionnaires are grounded in self-determination theory and are commonly employed in physical education research. Method Secondary school students from the United Kingdom (UK; n~=~300, mean age~=~13.71) and Hong Kong (HK; n~=~342, mean age~=~15.34 years) completed both questionnaires prior to a physical education lesson. Results Internal consistency analyses, as well as single and multi-group confirmatory factor analyses produced evidence that largely supported the reliability and validity of PLOCQ and SIMS scores in the UK sample. However, the analyses indicated some areas of concern regarding the internal consistency of the external and introjected regulation PLOCQ items in the HK sample. Also, identified regulation and intrinsic motivation constructs were not distinguishable by youth in either culture in either questionnaire. Finally, compared with the UK, students in HK interpreted the SIMS external regulation items to be more self-determined. Conclusions Researchers interested in studying contextual and situational motivation in UK physical education classes should, in general, feel confident in using the PLOCQ and the SIMS, respectively. However, our results highlight some important difficulties in the measurement of contextual and situational motivation in HK Chinese students. Further research is needed to better understand how students from different cultures respond to items intended to tap controlling forms of motivation.},

The estimated bounds are reasonably close together. Predictions at least ten days ahead as skilful as predictions now made seven days ahead appear to be possible. Additional improvements at extended range may be realized if the one-day forecast is capable of being improved significantly.},

Our reasoning is that even if the system would be intransitive if the external heating could be held fixed, say as in summer, the new heating patterns that actually accompany the advance of the seasons will break up any established summer circulation, and an alternative circulation may develop during the following summer, particularly if chaos has prevailed during the intervening winter. We introduce a very-low-order geostrophic baroclinic ``general circulation'' model, which may be run with or without seasonal variations of heating. Under perpetual summer conditions the model is intransitive, admitting either weakly oscillating or strongly oscillating westerly flow, while under perpetual winter conditions it is chaotic. When seasonal variations of heating are introduced, weak oscillations prevail through some summers and strong oscillations prevail through others, thus lending support to our original suggestion. We develop some additional properties of the model as a dynamical system, and we speculate as to whether its behaviour has a counterpart in the real world.},

We propose a new method for selecting the number of major common factors: the Hull method, which aims to find a model with an optimal balance between model fit and number of parameters. We examine the performance of the method in an extensive simulation study in which the simulated data are based on major and minor factors. The study compares the method with four other methods such as parallel analysis and the minimum average partial test, which were selected because they have been proven to perform well and/or they are frequently used in applied research. The Hull method outperformed all four methods at recovering the correct number of major factors. Its usefulness was further illustrated by its assessment of the dimensionality of the Five-Factor Personality Inventory (Hendriks, Hofstee, \& De Raad, 1999). This inventory has 100 items, and the typical methods for assessing dimensionality prove to be useless: the large number of factors they suggest has no theoretical justification. The Hull method, however, suggested retaining the number of factors that the theoretical background to the inventory actually proposes.},

A number of common barriers emerge from the three studies, which operate broadly at [`]individual' and [`]social' levels. These major constraints to individual engagement with climate change have implications for achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gases in the UK. We argue that targeted and tailored information provision should be supported by wider structural change to enable citizens and communities to reduce their carbon dependency. Policy implications for effective engagement are discussed.},

  abstract = {A number of recent research publications have shown that commonly used guidelines for interpreting effect sizes suggested by Cohen (1988) do not fit well with the empirical distribution of those effect sizes, and tend to overestimate them in many research areas. This study proposes empirically derived guidelines for interpreting effect sizes for research in social psychology, based on analysis of the true distributions of the two types of effect size measures widely used in social psychology (correlation coefficient and standardized mean differences). Analysis was carried out on the empirical distribution of 9884 correlation coefficients and 3580 Hedges' g statistics extracted from studies included in 98 published meta-analyses. The analysis reveals that the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to correlation coefficients values of 0.12, 0.25, and 0.42 and to Hedges' g values of 0.15, 0.38, and 0.69, respectively. This suggests that Cohen's guidelines tend to overestimate medium and large effect sizes. It is recommended that correlation coefficients of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40 and Hedges' g of 0.15, 0.40, and 0.70 should be interpreted as small, medium, and large effects for studies in social psychology. The analysis also shows that more than half of all studies lack sufficient sample size to detect a medium effect. This paper reports the sample sizes required to achieve appropriate statistical power for the identification of small, medium, and large effects. This can be used for performing appropriately powered future studies when information about exact effect size is not available.},

Analysis focuses on four issues: the likelihood of extreme impacts; concern over climate change versus other global problems; motivation to take action; and responsibility for the problem of climate change. It finds that seeing the film, at least in the short term, changed people's attitudes; viewers were significantly more concerned about climate change, and about other environmental risks. However, while the film increased anxiety about environmental risks, viewers experienced difficulty in distinguishing science fact from dramatized science fiction. Their belief in the likelihood of extreme events as a result of climate change was actually reduced. Following the film, many viewers expressed strong motivation to act on climate change. However, although the film may have sensitized viewers and motivated them to act, the public do not have information on what action they can take to mitigate climate change.},

Campbell, the fundamental measurement of extensive quantities is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) arbitrary combinations of ``quantities'' of a single specified kind. For example, the effect of placing one arbitrary combination of masses on a pan of a beam balance is compared with another arbitrary combination on the other pan. Measurement on a ratio scale follows from such axioms. In this paper, the essential character of simultaneous conjoint measurement is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) pairs formed from two specified kinds of ``quantities''. The axioms apply when, for example, the effect of a pair consisting of one mass and one difference in gravitational potential on a device that responds to momentum is compared with the effect of another such pair. Measurement on interval scales which have a common unit follows from these axioms; usually these scales can be converted in a natural way into ratio scales. A close relation exists between conjoint measurement and the establishment of response measures in a two-way table, or other analysis-of-variance situations, for which the ``effects of columns'' and the ``effects of rows'' are additive. Indeed, the discovery of such measures, which are well known to have important practical advantages, may be viewed as the discovery, via conjoint measurement, of fundamental measures of the row and column variables. From this point of view it is natural to regard conjoint measurement as factorial measurement.},

  abstract = {Ego-depletion, a psychological phenomenon in which participants are less able to engage in self-control after prior exertion of self-control, has become widely popular in the scientific community as well as in the media. However, considerable debate exists among researchers as to the nature of the ego-depletion effect, and growing evidence suggests the effect may not be as strong or robust as the extant literature suggests. We examined the robustness of the ego-depletion effect and aimed to maximize the likelihood of detecting the effect by using one of the most widely used depletion tasks (video-viewing attention control task) and by considering task characteristics and individual differences that potentially moderate the effect. We also sought to make our research plan transparent by pre-registering our hypotheses, procedure, and planned analyses prior to data collection. Contrary to the ego-depletion hypothesis, participants in the depletion condition did not perform worse than control participants on the subsequent self-control task, even after considering moderator variables. These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting ego-depletion is not a reliable phenomenon, though more research is needed that uses large sample sizes, considers moderator variables, and pre-registers prior to data collection.},

  abstract = {Background: The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length (2D:4D) is sexually dimorphic (mean 2D:4D is lower in males than females) and is thought to be fixed early in development. 2D:4D has been reported to be related to fetal growth, hand preference, autism, Asperger's syndrome, sperm counts, family size, age at myocardial infarction in men and breast cancer in women. There is indirect evidence that 2D:4D is established in utero and is negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively with prenatal estradiol. However, there are no studies which show direct relationships between fetal testosterone (FT), fetal estradiol (FE) and 2D:4D. Aims: To investigate the relationships between 2D:4D ratios and FT and FE from amniotic fluid. Study design: Cohort study. Subjects: 33 children. Outcome measures: Radioimmunoassays of FT and FE obtained from routine amniocentesis; 2D:4D ratios calculated from 2nd and 4th digit length of the right and left hands at age 2 years. Results: A significant negative association between right 2D:4D ratio and FT/FE ratio, which was independent of sex. Conclusions: These preliminary findings lend support to an association between low 2D:4D and high levels of FT relative to FE, and high 2D:4D with low FT relative to FE.},

In response, Robert (2016) maintains that Bayes factors have a number of serious shortcomings. These shortcomings, Robert argues, may be addressed by an alternative approach that conceptualizes model selection as parameter estimation in a mixture model. In a second comment, Chandramouli and Shiffrin (2016) seek to extend Jeffreys's framework by also taking into consideration data distributions that do not originate from either of the models under test. In this rejoinder we argue that Robert's (2016) alternative view on testing has more in common with Jeffreys's Bayes factor than he suggests, as they share the same ``shortcomings''. On the other hand, we show that the proposition of Chandramouli and Shiffrin (2016) to extend the Bayes factor is in fact further removed from Jeffreys's view on testing than the authors suggest. By elaborating on these points, we hope to clarify our case for Jeffreys's Bayes factors.},

Using Jeffreys's Bayes factor hypothesis tests, researchers can grade the decisiveness of the evidence that the data provide for a point null hypothesis H 0 versus a composite alternative hypothesis H 1 . Consequently, Jeffreys's tests are of considerable theoretical and practical relevance for empirical researchers in general and for experimental psychologists in particular. To highlight this relevance and to facilitate the interpretation and use of Jeffreys's Bayes factor tests we focus on two common inferential scenarios: testing the nullity of a normal mean (i.e.,~the Bayesian equivalent of the t -test) and testing the nullity of a correlation. For both Bayes factor tests, we explain their development, we extend them to one-sided problems, and we apply them to concrete examples from experimental psychology.},

A different aim is to choose between two possible hypotheses.

There are two fundamental approaches to such statistical analyses \textendash{} Bayesian and Frequentist.

Additionally, their performance in the examination was recorded. The structural equation model showed that statistics anxiety held a crucial role as the strongest direct predictor of performance. Students with higher statistics anxiety achieved less in the examination and showed higher procrastination scores. Statistics anxiety was related indirectly to spending less effort and time on learning. Trait anxiety was related positively to statistics anxiety and, counterintuitively, to academic performance. This result can be explained by the heterogeneity of the measure of trait anxiety. The part of trait anxiety that is unrelated to the specific part of statistics anxiety correlated positively with performance.},

Nonetheless, there is little reliable comparative international information on its extent or characteristics. We have conducted a seven-country comparative community study of deliberate self-harm among young people. Method:\hspace{0.6em} Over 30,000 mainly 15- and 16-year-olds completed anonymous questionnaires at school in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. Study criteria were developed to identify episodes of self-harm; the prevalence of self-harm acts and thoughts, methods used, repetition, reasons given, premeditation, setting for the act, associations with alcohol and drugs, hospitalisation, and whether other people knew, were examined. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Self-harm was more than twice as common among females as males and, in four of the seven countries, at least one in ten females had harmed herself in the previous year. Additional young people had thought of harming themselves without doing so. More males and females in all countries except Hungary cut themselves than used any other method, most acts took place at home, and alcohol and illegal drugs were not usually involved. The most common reasons given were `to get relief from a terrible state of mind' followed by `to die', although there were differences between those cutting themselves and those taking overdoses. About half the young people decided to harm themselves in the hour before doing so, and many did not attend hospital or tell anyone else. Just over half those who had harmed themselves during the previous year reported more than one episode over their lifetime. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Deliberate self-harm is a widespread yet often hidden problem in adolescents, especially females, which shows both similarities and differences internationally.},

  abstract = {Summary The purpose of this chronoepidemiologic study was to investigate the time-relationships between the yearly variations in occurrence of violent suicide in Belgium and the yearly variations in various biochemical, metabolic and immune variables in the Belgian population. The weekly mean number of deaths due to violent suicide for all of Belgium for the period 1979-1987 was computed. Twenty-six normal volunteers had monthly blood samplings during one calendar year for assays of plasma L-tryptophan (L-TRP), competing amino acids (CAA), and melatonin levels, maximal [3H]paroxetine binding to platelets, serum total cholesterol, calcium, magnesium, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentrations, and number of CD4+ T, CD8+ T and CD20+ B lymphocytes. The annual rhythm in violent suicide rate is highly significantly synchronized with the annual rhythms in L-TRP, [3H]paroxetine binding, cholesterol, calcium, magnesium, CD20+ B cells, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio; the mean peak (violent suicide, [3H]paroxetine binding) or nadir (all other variables) occurs around 3 May. There were significant inverse time-relationships between the time series of violent suicide rate and L-TRP, L-TRP/CAA ratio, total cholesterol, calcium and magnesium, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio and number of CD20+ B cells. Maximal [3H]paroxetine binding to platelets was significantly and positively related to the time series of violent suicide. An important part (56.4\%) of the variance in mean weekly number of violent suicide rate was explained by the time series of L-TRP, cholesterol and melatonin.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to assess the incidence of dental anxiety and factors associated with onset in adults aged 18 years and over. DESIGN: A longitudinal mail survey of a random sample of the general population consisting of a baseline phase and a follow-up after five years. SUBJECTS: 1,422 individuals completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires concerning dental anxiety; 1,226 subjects who were not anxious at baseline were included in the analysis. A sub-sample of 747 of these subjects had also completed a psychological questionnaire at baseline. MEASURES: Dental anxiety was assessed using the Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS). Other measures included the Dental Belief Survey, The Iowa Dental Control Index, a scale to measure attitudes towards pain, and measures of trait anxiety and general fearfulness. Questions were also asked about dental visiting patterns and dental treatment experiences prior to baseline and between baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: The five-year incidence of dental anxiety in this population was 5.8\%. This varied from 12.2\% in those aged 18 to 24 years at baseline to 1.7\% among those aged 65 years and over at baseline. Those reporting an episodic visiting pattern between baseline and follow-up and those who avoided dental care altogether were also more likely to become anxious about dental treatment. Seven variables entered a logistic regression model predicting onset: age at baseline, DAS score at baseline, fear of pain, dental visiting pattern and three variables indicating aversive dental experiences between baseline and follow-up. These were: experiencing pain during dental treatment; being treated by a dentist in a cold or uncaring manner and being frightened or worried about things the dentist did. Data from the 747 subjects completing the baseline psychological questionnaire indicated that scores on a trait anxiety index were also predictive of onset. CONCLUSION: Dental anxiety may arise during adulthood, younger adults being particularly vulnerable to onset. Both aversive conditioning experiences and pre-existing psychological states appear to be associated with the development of anxiety about dental treatment in this adult population.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, a great deal of news media attention has focused on informing the American public about scientific findings on global warming (GW). Has learning this sort of information led the American public to become more concerned about GW? Using data from two surveys of nationally representative samples of American adults, this article shows that the relation between self-reported knowledge and concern about GW is more complex than what previous research has suggested. Among people who trust scientists to provide reliable information about the environment and among Democrats and Independents, increased knowledge has been associated with increased concern. But among people who are skeptical about scientists and among Republicans more knowledge was generally not associated with greater concern. The association of knowledge with concern among Democrats and Independents who trust scientists was mediated by perceptions of consensus among scientists about GW's existence and by perceptions that humans are a principal cause of GW. Moreover, additional analyses of panel survey data produced findings consistent with the notion that more knowledge yields more concern among Democrats and Independents, but not among Republicans. Thus, when studying the relation of knowledge and concern, it is important to take into account the content of the information that different types of people acquire and choose to rely upon.

Consistent with previous research, the authors found a significant zero-order relationship between helping and empathic concern, the purported motivator of true altruism. This empathy-helping relationship disappeared, however, when nonaltruistic motivators (oneness and negative affect) were taken into account: Only the nonaltruistic factors of oneness (merged identity with the victim) and negative affect mediated helping, whereas empathic concern did not. Evidence for true altruism remains elusive.},

  abstract = {In its 2001 report on global climate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations prominently featured the "Hockey Stick," a chart showing global temperature data over the past one thousand years. The Hockey Stick demonstrated that temperature had risen with the increase in industrialization and use of fossil fuels. The inescapable conclusion was that worldwide human activity since the industrial age had raised CO2 levels, trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and warming the planet. The Hockey Stick became a central icon in the "climate wars," and well-funded science deniers immediately attacked the chart and the scientists responsible for it. Yet the controversy has had little to do with the depicted temperature rise and much more with the perceived threat the graph posed to those who oppose governmental regulation and other restraints to protect our environment and planet. Michael E. Mann, lead author of the original paper in which the Hockey Stick first appeared, shares the real story of the science and politics behind this controversy. He introduces key figures in the oil and energy industries, and the media front groups who do their bidding in sometimes slick, bare-knuckled ways to cast doubt on the science. Mann concludes with an account of the "Climategate" scandal, the 2009 hacking of climate scientists' emails. Throughout, Mann reveals the role of science deniers, abetted by an uninformed media, in once again diverting attention away from one of the central scientific and policy issues of our time.},

Voracek and Dressler (2006) used indirect finger measurements and found no significant associations with 2D:4D and SQ or EQ, whereas von Horn, B\"ackman, Davidsson, and Hansen (2010) reported significant correlations between 2D:4D and a composite measure of SQ and EQ using direct finger measurements.

We found (i) significant negative correlations of SQ with 2D:4D, this being stronger for right hand 2D:4D and independent of sex, age, height, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and education, (ii) no significant correlation of EQ and 2D:4D. We further examined mean 2D:4D's and found suggestions of a distortional effect of indirect finger measurement in the Voracek and Dressler (2006) study. Our results partly replicate those of von Horn et al. (2010) and emphasize the use of direct finger measurements when studying associations between 2D:4D and target traits with small effect size.},

Convergent evidence indicated that the relation between DN and BEH was stronger than the relation between IN and BEH. Evidence also suggested a significant direct relation between DN and BEH in the context of TPB. A suppressor effect of IN on DN in its relation with BEH was also noted. Moderator analyses indicated that the DN\textendash BEH relation was stronger when there was more time between measures of cognition and behaviour, when behaviours were not socially approved, more socially motive and more pleasant; results were mixed in the case of the IN\textendash BEH relation.

If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats.

Clinical studies have employed a range of serotonin indexes, including the cerebrospinal fluid level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the prolactin response to serotonin agonists, such as fenfluramine hydrochloride, and platelet serotonin-related proteins or serotonin content. Many of these indexes are correlated with suicidal behavior, but the interrelationship of these biologic measures has been uncertain. We studied the relationship of a series of serotonin indexes in patients in whom these measures were correlated with suicidal behavior. A positive correlation was found between cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and the maximal prolactin response to fenfluramine but not with platelet serotonin, receptor indexes. The fenfluramine-stimulated maximal prolactin response correlated with platelet serotonin2 receptor number, particularly in older patients. We conclude that cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid measurements cannot be replaced but can be complemented by less invasive procedures, such as a fenfluramine challenge test or platelet serotonin2 measures, in the study of the relationship of the serotonin system to psychiatric disorders.},

Based on analysis of 20 years of monthly data from St. Louis, MO, this study finds that most major crime types are likely to be impacted by rising temperatures. Whereas previous studies on the impact of climate change have used annual data, the current study suggests that shorter time periods provide a more accurate assessment once seasonality effects are accounted for. What is more this study incorporates not just temperature data, but also precipitation data. Results indicate that the relation between climate change and crime is significant for most crime categories. While the strength of the relationship between temperature anomalies and crime may appear relatively mild, considering potential future warming, climate change may come to have a significant impact on crime rates. Theory and policy implications are discussed.},

Regional variation in this predicted effect is detected, for example, with no apparent effects in former Soviet countries and far stronger effects found in Africa. Such variation indicates that climate change may acutely increase violence in areas that already are affected by higher levels of homicides and other social dislocations.},

Findings suggest that neighborhoods with higher levels of social disadvantage are very likely to experience higher levels of violence as a result of anomalously warm temperatures.

In the Samples section of Meta-Analysis 1: Reliability, third paragraph, the number of studies reporting data on clinical samples is incorrect. The sentence ``Four studies included clinical samples, and eight studies included nonclinical samples'' should read ``Twenty-four studies included clinical samples, and eight studies included nonclinical samples.''] In 2 meta-analyses involving 58 studies and 59,575 participants, we quantitatively summarized the relative reliability and validity of continuous (i.e., dimensional) and discrete (i.e., categorical) measures of psychopathology. Overall, results suggest an expected 15\% increase in reliability and 37\% increase in validity through adoption of a continuous over discrete measure of psychopathology alone. This increase occurs across all types of samples and forms of psychopathology, with little evidence for exceptions. For typical observed effect sizes, the increase in validity is sufficient to almost halve sample sizes necessary to achieve standard power levels. With important caveats, the current results, considered with previous research, provide sufficient empirical and theoretical basis to assume a priori that continuous measurement of psychopathology is more reliable and valid. Use of continuous measures in psychopathology assessment has widespread theoretical and practical benefits in research and clinical settings.},

Structural equation modeling found that positive attitudes toward different genetically modified organisms for food were significantly associated with higher trust in scientists and regulators (e.g. governments), and with lower trust in watchdogs (e.g. environmental movement). Public trust in scientists and watchdogs was a stronger predictor of attitudes toward the use of genetically modified plants for food than animals, but only when media coverage was low. Results are discussed regarding the moral acceptability of genetically modified organisms for food, the media's role in shaping public opinion, and the role public trust in organizations has on attitudes toward genetically modified organisms.},

Participants New Zealand Attitudes Values Study respondents in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 (Ns~=~17,890; 15,757; 13,904; 21,849; 17,031; and 47,462). Measurements Participants were asked, ``During the past month, on average, how many hours of actual sleep did you get per night?'' and responded to the K6 psychological distress scale each year. They also reported their demographic characteristics. Results Identified longitudinal associations between sleep duration and psychological distress in a traditional cross-lagged panel model were mostly attributable to the stability of the between-person differences in sleep duration and psychological distress. We provide evidence to suggest that increased sleep duration as indicated over a short period of time (ie, 1 month) predicted lower within-person levels of psychological distress the following year. Psychological distress did not predict sleep duration, in contrast. Conclusions Our analyses suggest that sleep duration in this sample of New Zealanders precedes psychological distress. This is significant given the propensity for short sleep in this sample and issues of poor mental health and short sleep among low SES indigenous members of this community. The promotion of adequate sleep duration may yield positive gains in psychological well-being.},

Validation data indicate that the four scales differentially relate in predicted ways to peer ratings of humor styles and to measures of mood (cheerfulness, depression, anxiety, hostility), self-esteem, optimism, well-being, intimacy, and social support. They also relate to all five dimensions of the Five Factor Model and to Agency and Communion. The first two scales overlap with previous humor tests, whereas the Aggressive and Self-defeating humor scales largely tap different dimensions. Males scored higher than females on Aggressive and Self-defeating humor. It is expected that the HSQ will be useful for research on humor and psychological well-being by assessing forms of humor that may be deleterious to health as well as those that are beneficial.},

Accordingly, the presented paper will attempt to tackle the genetics behind suicidal behavior from the perspective of the populational genetics. First, the variability of suicide rates across Europe is discussed. This is followed by a brief discussion of the J curve (on a map of Europe, the countries with a higher suicide rate form a so-called J curve, which starts in Finland and extends down to Slovenia), which maps on to the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, representing the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion. Furthermore, we will discuss whether the group of people living within the J-curve could share genes, which may not tolerate excessive amounts alcohol, the combination of which is more likely to end in suicidal behavior. Further along we list possible ways in which suicidal behaviour could have been selected for genetically in populations and identify those specific populations in which it may have appeared. Finally, we point at other locations in the world where a similar interplay of genes and environment has probably occurred, Greenland being the best example of the malignant interaction of alcohol consumption and the trait-like characteristics, which might constitute the vulnerability to suicidal behaviour. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We interviewed 27 African-American adolescents, 13\textendash 18 years old, who were not HIV-positive but whose mothers were living with HIV. As part of a broader study, adolescents responded to four open-ended questions regarding their experience of HIV stigma-by-association. Their responses were analyzed using ATLAS.ti to identify themes. About half of the teens had not told anyone their mother's HIV status but had heard peers make fun of or insult people with HIV. Anticipating stigma, teens used a range of strategies from being silent and vigilant to brushing off insults as ignorance and refusing to feel shame. In some instances, these strategies strained peer interactions and reinforced the mother/teen connection. With guidance, mothers may be well positioned to coach children and teens to identify stigma situations, manage those situations, and ultimately reduce stigma's impact on both adolescent and mother. Group interventions with HIV-affected teens, with or without parental involvement, can ameliorate the strained peer relationships which teens described, reducing their isolation and empowering them with knowledge and decision-making skills.},

We also provide perspectives on considerations and challenges relevant to the application of this guidance in the contribution of each Working Group to the Fifth Assessment Report. Despite the wide spectrum of disciplines encompassed by the three Working Groups, we expect that the framework of the new uncertainties guidance will enable consistent communication of the degree of certainty in their policy-relevant assessment findings.},

  abstract = {The internet era, large-scale computing and storage resources, mobile devices, social media, and their high uptake among different groups of people, have all deeply changed the way knowledge is created, communicated, and further deployed. These advances have enabled a radical transformation of the practice of science, which is now more open, more global and collaborative, and closer to society than ever. Open science has therefore become an increasingly important topic. Moreover, as open science is actively pursued by several high-profile funders and institutions, it has fast become a crucial matter to all researchers. However, because this widespread interest in open science has emerged relatively recently, its definition and implementation are constantly shifting and evolving, sometimes leaving researchers in doubt about how to adopt open science, and which are the best practices to follow. This article therefore aims to be a field guide for scientists who want to perform science in the open, offering resources and tips to make open science happen in the four key areas of data, code, publications and peer-review.},

Based on a general population sample of 1556 married men and women, it goes beyond previous efforts in two ways. First, it presents the first large-scale analysis of situational determinants of coping effectiveness in response to a wide variety of stressful life events and chronic difficulties. This analysis documents that previous aggregate analyses overlooked a number of specifications which, when observed, provide insights into the mechanisms of coping effectiveness. Second, it assesses the importance of two empirically generated multivariate coping profiles, passivity and versatility. The study's findings suggest that these profiles are associated significantly with adjustment to stress, that these associations differ across situations, and that they help to interpret the effects of separate coping strategies.},

The authors conducted a critical review of the literature to ascertain the strength of the scientific and professional evidence supporting an association between dental caries and the experience and severity of asthma. Types of Studies Reviewed. In March 2010, the authors searched Medline (1976\textendash 2010) by using the Ovid Web Gateway for the terms ``asthma'' and [``dental caries'' or ``dental caries susceptibility''] appearing in studies of humans published in English. The authors eliminated conference proceedings and abstracts, opinion pieces and unpublished studies; they included case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies and clinical trials. Results. The review yielded 27 studies described in 29 articles. The authors found that researchers have investigated the hypothesized relationship between asthma and caries by means of diverse strategies, often using asthma cases clustered in pools of patients seeking clinical care. The strongest methodological designs were more likely to reveal little support for a positive association. The authors found no strong evidence suggesting that a causal link exists. Future research incorporating better-defined covariates and longitudinal designs is needed. Clinical Implications. Asthma per se may not be a risk factor for caries. Patients who have extreme dryness of the mouth, whose use of nebulizers is persistent, whose consumption of carbohydrates is frequent, and who have used multiple medications or have used medications over the long term necessitate cautious dental health care.},

  abstract = {We consider Bayesian sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in observational studies where the association between a binary exposure, binary response, measured confounders and a single binary unmeasured confounder can be formulated using logistic regression models. A model for unmeasured confounding is presented along with a family of prior distributions that model beliefs about a possible unknown unmeasured confounder. Simulation from the posterior distribution is accomplished using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Because the model for unmeasured confounding is not identifiable, standard large-sample theory for Bayesian analysis is not applicable. Consequently, the impact of different choices of prior distributions on the coverage probability of credible intervals is unknown. Using simulations, we investigate the coverage probability when averaged with respect to various distributions over the parameter space. The results indicate that credible intervals will have approximately nominal coverage probability, on average, when the prior distribution used for sensitivity analysis approximates the sampling distribution of model parameters in a hypothetical sequence of observational studies. We motivate the method in a study of the effectiveness of beta blocker therapy for treatment of heart failure. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This article uses longitudinal data and cross-lagged modeling to infer the direction of influence in a post-election context.

This suggests that partisan politics increases fluctuations in climate change skepticism, and there may be more or less opportune times to pursue climate change policies. Similar research is now needed in pre- and mid-election cycle contexts to determine the direction of influence over the election cycle.},

We examine the conservative movement's efforts to undermine climate science and policy in the USA over the last two decades by using this second dimension of power. The conservative movement has employed four non-decision-making techniques to challenge the legitimacy of climate science and prevent progress in policy-making. We argue that reflexive modernization scholars should focus more attention on similar forces of anti-reflexivity that continue to shape the overall direction of our social, political and economic order, and the life chances of many citizens. Indeed, better understanding of the forces and effectiveness of anti-reflexivity may very well be crucial for societal resilience and adaptation, especially in the face of global environmental problems like climate change.},

We utilize public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from 2001 to 2010, focusing specifically on five indicators of climate change denial. We find that conservative white males are significantly more likely than are other Americans to endorse denialist views on all five items, and that these differences are even greater for those conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming very well. Furthermore, the results of our multivariate logistic regression models reveal that the conservative white male effect remains significant when controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender as well as the effects of nine control variables. We thus conclude that the unique views of conservative white males contribute significantly to the high level of climate change denial in the United States.},

Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering, and other applications.The authors focus on examining the way a response variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment, and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

Studies in urban areas show an association between increases in mortality and increases in heat, measured by maximum or minimum temperature, heat index, and sometimes, other weather conditions. Health effects associated with exposure to extreme and prolonged heat appear to be related to environmental temperatures above those to which the population is accustomed. Models of weather-mortality relationships indicate that populations in northeastern and midwestern U.S. cities are likely to experience the greatest number of illnesses and deaths in response to changes in summer temperature. Physiologic and behavioral adaptations may reduce morbidity and mortality. Within heat-sensitive regions, urban populations are the most vulnerable to adverse heat-related health outcomes. The elderly, young children, the poor, and people who are bedridden or are on certain medications are at particular risk. Heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable through behavioral adaptations, including the use of air conditioning and increased fluid intake. Overall death rates are higher in winter than in summer, and it is possible that milder winters could reduce deaths in winter months. However, the relationship between winter weather and mortality is difficult to interpret. Other adaptation measures include heat emergency plans, warning systems, and illness management plans. Research is needed to identify critical weather parameters, the associations between heat and nonfatal illnesses, the evaluation of implemented heat response plans, and the effectiveness of urban design in reducing heat retention.},

  abstract = {The late 19th and early 20th Centuries saw the consolidation in physics of the three main traditions that predominate in discussions of measurement theory. These are: (i) the systematic tradition pioneered by Maxwell; (ii) the representational tradition pioneered by Campbell; and (iii) the operational tradition pioneered by Bridgman (1927). These divergent approaches created uncertainty about the nature of measurement in the physical sciences and provided Stevens (1946) with an opportunity and rationale to, in effect, reinvent the definition of scientific measurement. Stevens appropriated the representational and operational traditions as the sole basis for his definition of measurement, excluding any place for the systematic approach. In committing to Stevens' path, the psychological sciences were blinded to the advances made in metrology, the establishment of the International System (SI) and the standard units contained within this system. These advances were only possible due to the deep conceptual and instrumental connections between the system of physical units and the body of physical theory and laws developed over the preceding centuries. It is argued that if the psychological sciences are to ever achieve equivalent methodological advances, they must bridge this `metrological gap' created by Stevens' measurement crossroads and understand the ways in which the systematic approach advanced measurement. This means that psychological measurement needs to be de-abstracted, rid of operational rules for numerical assignment and set upon a foundation of quantitative theory, definition and law. In the absence of such theoretical foundations, claims of measurement in the psychological sciences remain a methodological chimera.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE Currently, fewer than 40\% of patients treated for major depressive disorder achieve remission with initial treatment. Identification of a biological marker that might improve these odds could have significant health and economic impact. OBJECTIVE To identify a candidate neuroimaging ``treatment-specific biomarker'' that predicts differential outcome to either medication or psychotherapy. DESIGN Brain glucose metabolism was measured with positron emission tomography prior to treatment randomization to either escitalopram oxalate or cognitive behavior therapy for 12 weeks. Patients who did not remit on completion of their phase 1 treatment were offered enrollment in phase 2 comprising an additional 12 weeks of treatment with combination escitalopram and cognitive behavior therapy. SETTING Mood and anxiety disorders research program at an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Men and women aged 18 to 60 years with currently untreated major depressive disorder. INTERVENTION Randomized assignment to 12 weeks of treatment with either escitalopram oxalate (10\textendash 20 mg/d) or 16 sessions of manual-based cognitive behavior therapy. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Remission, defined as a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 7 or less at both weeks 10 and 12, as assessed by raters blinded to treatment. RESULTS Positive and negative predictors of remission were identified with a 2-way analysis of variance treatment (escitalopram or cognitive behavior therapy) \texttimes{} outcome (remission or nonresponse) interaction. Of 65 protocol completers, 38 patients with clear outcomes and usable positron emission tomography scans were included in the primary analysis: 12 remitters to cognitive behavior therapy, 11 remitters to escitalopram, 9 nonresponders to cognitive behavior therapy, and 6 nonresponders to escitalopram. Six limbic and cortical regions were identified, with the right anterior insula showing the most robust discriminant properties across groups (effect size = 1.43). Insula hypometabolism (relative to whole-brain mean) was associated with remission to cognitive behavior therapy and poor response to escitalopram, while insula hypermetabolism was associated with remission to escitalopram and poor response to cognitive behavior therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE If verified with prospective testing, the insula metabolism-based treatment-specific biomarker defined in this study provides the first objective marker, to our knowledge, to guide initial treatment selection for depression.

Yet, despite their pervasiveness, until recently social psychology has been, as the authors of "Time and Human Interaction" put it, virtually "timeless." Neither the temporal assumptions implicit in the psychologist's observations, theories, and measurements, nor the effects of cultural conceptions of time or social interactions, have received more than scant attention. In this ambitious new work, Joseph McGrath and Janice Kelly explore the reasons for this neglect, lay bare some of the assumptions about time underlying current research, and map out three broad areas of concern to psychology: the effects of temporal factors, such as time pressure, on behavior; the influence of social and psychological factors on the temporal patterning of behavior, on individual experiences, and uses of time; and finally, the temporal features of research methodology. Woven from such diverse sources as the philosophy of time, psychological analyses of time judgements, biological studies of entrainment, and social psychological investigations of effects of time limits and work shifts, this volume offers a unique synthesis of conceptual, methodological, and substantive issues in the social psychology of time. Problems long ignored because of their complexity are presented clearly and compellingly, making this an important book for students of business and organizational dynamics as well as social psychologists and advanced students interested in time, group processes, and research methodology.},

Two of the more commonly used heterogeneity tests are Bartlett's and Cochran's, although, as for most of these tests, they may well be more sensitive to violations of the anova assumptions than is anova itself. Simulations were used to examine how well these two tests protected anova against the problems created by variance heterogeneity. Although Cochran's test performed a little better than Bartlett's, both tests performed poorly, frequently disallowing perfectly valid analyses. Recommendations are made about how to proceed, given these results.},

  author = {McKeon, Gemma},
  abstract = {Neurocognitive theories of reactive aggression have proposed that such behaviour is associated with both dysfunctional emotional processes, such as facial affect recognition, and impairments in executive functions such as response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Presently, no single study has examined both cognitive and emotional predictors of reactive aggression. This was the aim of the current experiment. Eighty-six healthy volunteers were recruited. Aggression was measured using the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). Emotional reactivity to provocation during the PSAP was measured using facial electromyography. Emotional processing was assessed using a visual search task measuring reaction time to locate emotional facial expressions. Self-reported emotional regulation strategies and experience of anger were also assessed. Two components of executive cognitive functioning, response inhibition and cognitive flexibility, were measured using the stop signal reaction paradigm and a set-shifting task. Self-reported impulsiveness was also assessed. It was hypothesised that aggression would be predicted by poorer performance on measures cognitive functioning, greater physiological reactivity during provocation, impaired attention to emotional faces, higher levels of self-reported impulsiveness and anger, and lower self-reported positive emotional regulation strategies. One significant cognitive (set-shifting) and emotional (processing) correlate of aggression were observed. When entered into a regression analysis only accurate set-shifting ability was predictive of aggression in the model. Hypotheses were not supported for other variables. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

Some anxiety was reported by 85\% of patients (mean level 2.9; SD 1.2). Anxiety levels were lower in patients who had recently received sedatives or opioids but were not related to heart rate or blood pressure. \textbullet{} Conclusions The Faces Anxiety Scale is a valid means of measuring anxiety in intensive care patients.

  abstract = {A new method for the analysis of linear models that have autoregressive errors is proposed. The approach is not only relevant in the behavioral sciences for analyzing small-sample time-series intervention models, but it is also appropriate for a wide class of small-sample linear model problems in which there is interest in inferential statements regarding all regression parameters and autoregressive parameters in the model. The methodology includes a double application of bootstrap procedures. The lst application is used to obtain bias-adjusted estimates of the autoregressive parameters. The 2nd application is used to estimate the standard errors of the parameter estimates. Theoretical and Monte Carlo results are presented to demonstrate asymptotic and small-sample properties of the method; examples that illustrate advantages of the new approach over established time-series methods are described.

The recent (globally averaged) warming by 0{$\cdot$}5\textdegree C is partly attributable to such anthropogenic emissions. Climate change will affect human health in many ways--mostly adversely. Here, we summarise the epidemiological evidence of how climate variations and trends affect various health outcomes. We assess the little evidence there is that recent global warming has already affected some health outcomes. We review the published estimates of future health effects of climate change over coming decades. Research so far has mostly focused on thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases, with some attention to estimates of future regional food yields and hunger prevalence. An emerging broader approach addresses a wider spectrum of health risks due to the social, demographic, and economic disruptions of climate change. Evidence and anticipation of adverse health effects will strengthen the case for pre-emptive policies, and will also guide priorities for planned adaptive strategies.},

  abstract = {A common way to form scores from multiple-item scales is to sum responses of all items. Though sum scoring is often contrasted with factor analysis as a competing method, we review how factor analysis and sum scoring both fall under the larger umbrella of latent variable models, with sum scoring being a constrained version of a factor analysis. Despite similarities, reporting of psychometric properties for sum scored or factor analyzed scales are quite different. Further, if researchers use factor analysis to validate a scale but subsequently sum score the scale, this employs a model that differs from validation model. By framing sum scoring within a latent variable framework, our goal is to raise awareness that (a) sum scoring requires rather strict constraints, (b) imposing these constraints requires the same type of justification as any other latent variable model, and (c) sum scoring corresponds to a statistical model and is not a model-free arithmetic calculation. We discuss how unjustified sum scoring can have adverse effects on validity, reliability, and qualitative classification from sum score cut-offs. We also discuss considerations for how to use scale scores in subsequent analyses and how these choices can alter conclusions. The general goal is to encourage researchers to more critically evaluate how they obtain, justify, and use multiple-item scale scores.},

They also completed the attribution-focused `Causes of Third-World Poverty Questionnaire' (CTWPQ). Business students tended to disagree less than social science students with blaming-the-poor for poverty. More importantly, a cropped image condition resulted in significantly elevated blame-the-poor scores among business students, but not those in social science.

However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10\%-12\% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses. Recommendations include using identified rather than anonymous responses, incorporating instructed response items before data collection, as well as computing consistency indices and multivariate outlier analysis to ensure high-quality data.},

Using simulated data with a known lack of invariance, the authors illustrate how models using parcels as indicator variables erroneously indicate that measurement invariance exists much more often than do models using items as indicators.

In comparison with younger people older S tended to display greater Morningness-Eveningness scores. These results suggest that ageing relates to a shifting toward morningness.

Morning-types had significantly higher N scores and tended to be insignificantly more introverted. Evening-types had significantly higher N scores and tended to be insignificantly more extraverted. The present findings are consistent with reports of a tendency for morning-types to be introverted and for evening-types extraverted. However, they do provide some evidence of individual differences on the neuroticism and psychoticism dimensions of personality between the two diurnal types.},

A Partial Credit Rasch model was applied to investigate the psychometric properties of four different versions of the FFMQ, ranging from 15 to 24 items, in a sample of 400 participants who completed FFMQ items in English. The best fit to the Rasch model was achieved after the 24-item Dutch FFMQ version was reduced to 18 items by removing locally dependent and misfitting items and combining subscales items into super-items. These results support the psychometric properties and internal validity of the modified 18-item FFMQ (FFMQ-18) as a global short measure of the mindfulness construct and its individual facets. Ordinal responses to the FFMQ-18 can be transformed into interval-level data, using the ordinal-to-interval conversion tables presented here and thus increase accuracy of measurement for the total and subscale scores. This short version is useful for comparisons of mindfulness and its facets at a group level or when investigating the associations of mindfulness with other variables, but the full-scale version is recommended for comparison of individuals' pre- and post-intervention mindfulness levels.},

While the instrument has been shown to possess generally acceptable psychometric properties, no work so far has been conducted to increase the precision of the instrument and its subscales in discriminating between individual trait levels. The present study used Rasch analysis to assess the psychometric properties of the FFMQ using a sample of 296 participants, with the intention to improve the scale if necessary. The best fit to the Rasch model for all five FFMQ subscales and the total scale was achieved after minor modifications that involved combining locally dependent items into subtests and removing two items (24 and 32) that critically affected the goodness-of-fit indices. These findings support the psychometric properties and internal construct validity of the modified FFMQ, and ordinal-to-interval Rasch conversion tables are included here that can be used to increase the precision of measurement without requiring any modifications of the original FFMQ response format.

While its psychometric properties are acknowledged to be acceptable, it presents scores on an ordinal scale and may thus not discriminate precisely between individual happiness levels. The current study aimed to improve precision and item functioning of the OHQ by applying Rasch analysis to a sample of 281 participants. To correct disordered thresholds items were rescored in a uniform fashion. Four items displayed poor relationships with the latent trait of happiness and were removed. Best fit to the unidimensional Rasch model was achieved after locally dependent items were combined into subtests and adjusted for personal differences. Using the ordinal-to-interval conversion tables published here, ordinal OHQ scores can now be transformed to interval level data and thus subjected to parametric statistical analysis without violating fundamental assumptions.

In most psychological research, improved power of a statistical design leads to a prior probability approaching 1/2 of finding a significant difference in the theoretically predicted direction. Hence the corroboration yielded by "success" is very weak, and becomes weaker with increased precision. "Statistical significance" plays a logical role in psychology precisely the reverse of its role in physics. This problem is worsened by certain unhealthy tendencies prevalent among psychologists, such as a premium placed on experimental "cuteness" and a free reliance upon ad hoc explanations to avoid refutation.},

  abstract = {This study examines sexual behavior, serotonin turnover in the central nervous system, and testosterone in free-ranging non-human primates. Study subjects were 33 young adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) living in naturalistic social groups on a 475-acre South Carolina barrier island. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained during random trappings, and the subjects were located for observation by radio telemetry. Quantitative behavioral samples totaling 203 observation hours were taken during two mating seasons (September through January) in 1994 and 1995. Control observations (65 h) on 13 subjects were also taken during the non-mating seasons in 1994 and 1995. The results indicate that CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), CSF testosterone, and plasma testosterone concentrations increase significantly during the mating season. During the mating season, there were significant increases in high intensity aggression, low intensity aggression, grooming behavior, and heterosexual mounting. In the mating season, CSF 5-HIAA was significantly correlated with several sociosexual behaviors: consorts per hour, heterosexual mounts per hour, and inseminations per hour. In contrast to previous findings from the non-mating season, CSF 5-HIAA was not correlated with any measures of aggression or sociality, although during consorting, CSF 5-HIAA was positively correlated with grooming. From these findings, we conclude that the lack of correlation between intense and severe aggression and CSF 5-HIAA in the mating season may reflect the use of high intensity aggression in [`]normative' male-male competition over access to reproductively active females. We also conclude that CNS serotonin turnover is positively correlated with sexual competence, i.e. males with low CSF 5-HIAA concentrations are less sexually competent than males with higher concentrations. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract = {Zoos and aquariums are increasingly incorporating conservation education into their mission statements and visitor experiences to address global biodiversity loss. To advance knowledge and practice in the field, research is being conducted to evaluate the effect of zoo conservation-education experiences on visitor psychosocial outcomes (e.g., knowledge, attitude, emotions, motivations, behavior). Following recent discussions among scholars and practitioners concerning logistical and methodological challenges that likely undermine the conclusions of such research, we identified and reviewed the methods and reporting practices in peer-reviewed articles published in English from May 1998 to June 2016 that focused on adult visitor samples (47 articles, 48 studies). We examined elements of internal, external, construct, and statistical conclusion validity. Methodological quality of quantitative methods and reporting practices was determined using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. Each study was coded as either strong (no weak ratings), moderate (1 weak rating), or weak (‡£ô2 weak ratings). The quantitative methods of 83.3\% of studies were weak. The remaining 16.7\% had methods of moderate quality. Using an existing checklist, we also assessed the quality and rigor of qualitative methods and reporting practices and found that some aspects of these methods were reported more comprehensively than others. For example, 69.6\% of articles discussed methods for identifying key themes from the data, whereas only 34.8\% reported how data verification was performed. We suggest increased application of intensive longitudinal methods (e.g., daily diary) to strengthen self-reported data, experimental and repeated-measures designs, and mixed-methods approaches. Our findings and recommendations could strengthen and guide the research and evaluation agenda for the field and ultimately enhance the contribution zoos make to global biodiversity conservation.},

Design Survey for the purpose of testing reliability and validity of a new scale. Setting Memory Disorder Clinic at a university-affiliated hospital in the Upper Midwest. Patients Forty-six patients were diagnosed with clinically probable dementia of the Alzheimer type after a dementia evaluation, and 26 normal elderly controls were research volunteers without a history of cognitive dysfunction. Measurements Neuropsychological tests, dementia-related scales, and clock drawings rated by a new 20-item Clock Drawing Interpretation Scale. Reliability measures, correlations, and clustering of items in the CDIS. Results The CDIS had inter-rater reliability (r = .94), internal consistence (rtt = .95), and reproducibility over a 6-month interval. CDIS scores were significantly correlated with two dementia-related scales and all neuropsychological tests and had the highest correlations with other measures of constructional apraxia. All but four Alzheimer patients (91\%) and none of the controls had CDIS scores of 18 or less. Conclusion Clinicians may reliably screen patients with Alzheimer's disease with the clock-drawing task, a measure sensitive to deficits in constructional apraxia.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a Bayesian formulation of the so-called magnitude-based inference approach to quantifying and interpreting effects, and in a case study example provide accurate probabilistic statements that correspond to the intended magnitude-based inferences. The model is described in the context of a published small-scale athlete study which employed a magnitude-based inference approach to compare the effect of two altitude training regimens (live high-train low (LHTL), and intermittent hypoxic exposure (IHE)) on running performance and blood measurements of elite triathletes. The posterior distributions, and corresponding point and interval estimates, for the parameters and associated effects and comparisons of interest, were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The Bayesian analysis was shown to provide more direct probabilistic comparisons of treatments and able to identify small effects of interest. The approach avoided asymptotic assumptions and overcame issues such as multiple testing. Bayesian analysis of unscaled effects showed a probability of 0.96 that LHTL yields a substantially greater increase in hemoglobin mass than IHE, a 0.93 probability of a substantially greater improvement in running economy and a greater than 0.96 probability that both IHE and LHTL yield a substantially greater improvement in maximum blood lactate concentration compared to a Placebo. The conclusions are consistent with those obtained using a `magnitude-based inference' approach that has been promoted in the field. The paper demonstrates that a fully Bayesian analysis is a simple and effective way of analysing small effects, providing a rich set of results that are straightforward to interpret in terms of probabilistic statements.},

A close statistical association was established between annual assault and rape rhythms and annual temperature fluctuations in the different locations.

  abstract = {In a comment, hitherto unremarked upon, Alfred Binet, well known for constructing the first intelligence scale, claimed that his scale did not measure intelligence, but only enabled classification with respect to a hierarchy of intellectual qualities.  Attempting to understand the reasoning behind this comment leads to an historical excursion, beginning with the ancient mathematician, Euclid and ending with the modern French philosopher, Henri Bergson.  As Euclid explained (Heath, 1908), magnitudes constituting a given quantitative attribute are all of the same kind (i.e., homogeneous), but his criterion covered only extensive magnitudes.  Duns Scotus (Cross, 1998) included intensive magnitudes by considering differences, which raised the possibility (later considered by Kant (Sutherland, 2004)) of ordered attributes with heterogeneous differences between degrees (``heterogeneous orders'').  Of necessity, such attributes are non-measurable.  Subsequently, this became a basis for the ``quantity objection'' to psychological measurement, as developed first by Tannery (1875) and then by Bergson (1889).  It follows that for attributes investigated in science, there are three structural possibilities:  (1) classificatory attributes (with heterogeneous differences between categories);  (2) heterogeneous orders (with heterogeneous differences between degrees); and  (3) quantitative attributes (with thoroughly homogeneous differences between magnitudes).    Measurement is possible only with attributes of kind (3) and, as far as we know, psychological attributes are exclusively of kinds (1) or (2).  However, contrary to the known facts, psychometricians, for their own special reasons insist that test scores provide measurements.},

Psychologists think that theorising in the area of psychological testing involves conjuring constructs, which are operationally defined and measured via psychometric tests. However, the `construct' concept is unworkable and laden with confused philosophical baggage accrued under the hegemony of logical empiricism, and its real function in psychology is obscured. Via an analysis of its history and logic, I expose its flawed conception of the relation between theoretical and observable concepts and the way in which it serves the myth of mental measurement. Finally, it is shown how the actual logic of theorising in science, which entails that theories are best inferred from relevant phenomena, not imaginatively constructed, oppugns this myth and promises to coordinate theoretical concepts with the phenomena to be explained.},

They appeal to the Quine-Duhem thesis in an attempt to argue that item response models do not allow the hypothesis that psychological attributes are quantitative to be tested in isolation, but their argument is based upon a misinterpretation of Duhem. In any experiment, what is being tested depends on what the experimenter already takes to be true, and it is possible that a psychometrician could be testing just one of the hypotheses constituting an item response model. Furthermore, using the theory of conjoint measurement, it is possible to isolate predictions that depend upon psychological attributes being quantitative, as opposed to merely ordinal. Despite this, Borsboom and Mellenbergh agree with the first part of my thesis. They do not discuss the second part, but an examination of textbooks on item response models shows that psychometricians disguise their failure to test the hypothesis that psychological attributes are quantitative by simply declining to mention that this hypothesis is presumed in their models. Claims to measure psychological attributes based upon these models depend exclusively upon the weakest part of these models: the hypothesis that the distribution of `errors' takes a specific form.},

Measurement is defined as the estimation of numerical relations (or ratios) between magnitudes of a quantitative attribute and a unit. The history of scientific measurement, from antiquity to the present may be interpreted as revealing a progressive deepening in the understanding of this position. First, the concept of ratio was broadened to include ratios between incommensurable magnitudes; second, the concept of a quantitative attribute was broadened to include non-extensive quantities; third, quantitative structure and its relations to ratios and real numbers were elaborated; and finally, the issue of empirically distinguishing between quantitative and non-quantitative structures was addressed. This interpretation of measurement understands it in a way that is continuous with scientific investigation in general, i.e., as an attempt to discover independently existing facts.},

The author argues that the idea of measurement now endorsed within psychology actually subverts attempts to establish a genuinely quantitative science, and he urges a new direction. This volume relates views on measurement by thinkers such as H\"older, Russell, Campbell, and Nagel to earlier views, like those of Euclid and Oresme. Within the history of psychology, it considers contributions by Fechner, Cattell, Thorndike, Stevens and Suppes, among others. It also contains a nontechnical exposition of conjoint measurement theory and recent foundational work by leading measurement theorist R. Duncan Luce.

It is then shown that the hypothesis upon which psychometrics stands, the hypothesis that some psychological attributes are quantitative, has never been critically tested. Furthermore, it is shown that psychometrics has avoided investigating this hypothesis through endorsing an anomalous definition of measurement. In this way, the failure to test this key hypothesis is not only ignored but disguised.

Most of the founders of the discipline committed it and it makes sense of otherwise anomalous developments within the discipline, such as the permissible statistics controversy and the dominant form taken by item response theories. The fallacy is displayed by showing (1) that an attribute's quantitative structure reduces to a weak order upon differences between degrees that satisfies the double cancellation, solvability, and Archimedean conditions of conjoint measurement theory and (2) the fact that any order on the degrees themselves does not entail sufficient structure on this weak order to guarantee satisfaction of these conditions. Thus, it is possible that an ordered attribute is non-quantitative. Also, each pair of differences between degrees of an ordinal attribute falls into one of two disjoint classes: (1) those where the order relation between the pair follows from an order on the attribute and (2) those where it is independent of that order and possibly diagnostic of quantitative structure and this fact means that the distinction between order and quantity is an empirical one.},

  abstract = {The quantitative imperative is the view that in science, when you cannot measure, you do not really know what you are talking about, but when you can, you do, and, therefore, qualitative methods have no place in psychology. On the basis of this imperative, qualitative research methods are still excluded from mainstream psychology. Where does this view come from? Many qualitative researchers think it is an expression of positivism. Is this attribution correct? Then again, qualitative researchers often confuse positivism with naive realism. What is the relationship between the quantitative imperative and naive realism? In this paper it is shown that in finding opposition, qualitative researchers did not, as they sometimes allege, come up against the hard, positivistic edge of science. They encountered something at once much more deep-seated than positivism but also something much less hardheaded than they suppose positivism to have been. Indeed, perhaps surprisingly, positivism is no barrier to qualitative methods. As for naive realism, it provides a firm foundation for qualitative methods in psychology. It is argued that in psychology, the quantitative imperative is an egregious, potentially self-perpetuating form of methodological error.},

  abstract = {Stevens's theory of scales of measurement has been an important methodological resource within psychology for half a century. It advanced the representational theory of measurement and promised to open up to scientific investigation the issue of the structure of psychological attributes. Its development by Suppes and Zinnes and the axiomatic measurement theory tradition showed how that promise could be fulfilled. However, neither Stevens nor the psychometricians who adopted his theory used it in that way. They used it to foreclose scientific investigation of that issue. This paper examines the way in which this was done and offers reasons for it. This is a revised version of a paper delivered at the 20th Annual Conference of the European Society for the History of the Human Sciences, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, August, 2001.},

  abstract = {Background: Family members experience stigma via their connection with the affected member. Family stigma contains stereotypes of blame, shame and contamination. Aim: To establish the tendency towards stigmatization of family members of a person with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) by a sample of the general public of Belgrade. Methods: The sample encompassed 181 participants, of various ages and levels of education, and of different, self-assessed levels of knowledge about autism. The structure of stigmatization of family members of a person with ASD was explored applying the Family Stigma Questionnaire (FSQ) and the Level of Familiarity Questionnaire (LFQ). Results: Analysis of the obtained results established that scores indicating the tendency towards stigmatization were most pronounced for variables connected to blame for deterioration of the condition of the person with autism, contamination of the individual family members by the condition, and to feeling pity for family members of a person with ASD. Statistically significant differences were established when the FSQ scores stigmatizing parents and siblings were compared. Significant differences in stigmatizing stereotypes were established according to gender and level of education, and according to the self-assessment of knowledge about autism and the level of previous contact to persons with mental disorders. Conclusion: Anti-stigma programmes are important especially bearing in mind that participants who self-evaluated as having the least knowledge about ASD demonstrated the highest tendency towards stigmatizing the parents of a person suffering from ASD, and those of lower education demonstrated the highest tendency towards stigmatizing the family members.},

We explain the connection by way of the principle of restricted choice, an inferential rule from the game of contract bridge, which makes clear how information is revealed from the action of an optimizing opponent/partner. We propose that the principle is most naturally formalized with the odds form representation of Bayes rule, and show how it can make puzzles that are typically seen as paradoxical, intuitive. We illustrate how knowledge of such puzzles, and the principle of restricted choice, may help researchers avoid particular critical errors when designing experiments and analyzing data. Further, we provide examples in research domains that include the hot hand and Psi (ESP). Finally, we use restricted choice to illustrate the conceptual, and quantitative, relationship between a version of the well-known Berkson's Paradox and the aforementioned selection bias.},

Half in each group were exposed to voluminous preparatory information, and half to the usual low level of information. Subjective, physiological, and behavioral measures of arousal and discomfort were obtained before, during, and after the procedure. Overall, low-information Ss expressed less subjective and behavioral arousal than monitors. In addition, Ss' level of psychophysiological arousal was lower when the level of preparatory information was consistent with their coping style; that is, blunters were less aroused with low information, and monitors were less aroused with high information. Monitors also took longer to recover from the procedure than did blunters, and monitors continued to show more discomfort and pain after 2 days. Results are discussed with reference to the issue of informed consent. (54 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

This survey confirms that young New Zealand women, but not men, experience the body image dissatisfaction deemed normative for women living in Westernised cultures. Women, but not men, selected significantly smaller ideal figures than the figures they thought and felt their bodies looked like. Both men and women were equally aware of the importance society places on physical attractiveness and being thin, but women reported significantly greater internalisation of thinness norms. Total media consumption, which did not significantly differ as a function of gender, was correlated with increased awareness and internalisation of thinness ideals for both men and women but only predicted body perceptions in the latter. Overall, these results suggest that New Zealand women, but not men, are unhappy with their bodies and want to be thinner.},

  abstract = {Purpose A long tradition of research has shown a relationship between suicide rates and socio-economic factors. However, most investigations have neglected to account for country-specific influences. The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between socio-economic variables and gender-specific suicide rates in 35 countries, using analytic techniques able to control for effects embedded within different country contexts. Method Data relating to male and female age-standardised suicide rates (obtained from the WHO Statistical Information System) were analysed using fixed-effect regression. The possible associations between suicide rates and social variables were tested using data for 35 countries over the period 1980\textendash 2006. Results Findings indicated that higher male and female suicide rates were associated with increased female labour force participation, unemployment, and the proportion of persons over 65 years. Reductions in male and female suicide rates were associated with increased health spending per capita. The study also revealed that higher fertility was associated with a reduction in male suicide. Female labour force participation had a stronger effect on male suicide rates. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that variables related to the labour market and the economy were better explanatory factors of suicide rates than population-level indicators of interpersonal relationships. Although results were generally similar for males and females, males appeared to be more sensitive to changes in the social environment than women.},

Bayesian Latent Growth Modeling identified systematic variation in the growth trajectory of conservatism that was predicted by age and socio-economic status. Younger people (ages 25-45) did not change in their political orientation. Older people, however, became more conservative over time. Likewise, people with lower socio-economic status showed a marked increase in political conservatism. In addition, tests of rank-order stability showed that age had a cubic relationship with the stability of political orientation over our four annual assessments. Our findings provide strong support for System Justification Theory by showing that increases in conservatism in the wake of the recent global financial crisis occurred primarily among the poorest and most disadvantaged.},

The answer is not a simple ``yes'' or ``no'' but is related to hypotheses, objectives, risks, and paradigms. In this paper, we took a pragmatic approach. We applied both types of methods to the analysis of actual Likert data on responses from different professional subgroups of European pharmacists regarding competencies for practice. Results obtained show that with ``large'' (\&gt;15) numbers of responses and similar (but clearly not normal) distributions from different subgroups, parametric and non-parametric analyses give in almost all cases the same significant or non-significant results for inter-subgroup comparisons. Parametric methods were more discriminant in the cases of non-similar conclusions. Considering that the largest differences in opinions occurred in the upper part of the 4-point Likert scale (ranks 3 ``very important'' and 4 ``essential''), a ``score analysis'' based on this part of the data was undertaken. This transformation of the ordinal Likert data into binary scores produced a graphical representation that was visually easier to understand as differences were accentuated. In conclusion, in this case of Likert ordinal data with high response rates, restraining the analysis to non-parametric methods leads to a loss of information. The addition of parametric methods, graphical analysis, analysis of subsets, and transformation of data leads to more in-depth analyses.},

Adaptation to climate change is dependent on current adaptive capacity and the development models that are being pursued by developing countries. Various frameworks are available for vulnerability and adaptation (V\&A) assessments, and they have both advantages and limitations. Investments in developing countries are more focused on recovery from a disaster than on the creation of adaptive capacity. Extreme climatic events create a spiral of debt burden on developing countries. Increased capacity to manage extreme weather events can reduce the magnitude of economic, social and human damage and eventually, investments, in terms of borrowing money from the lending agencies. Vulnerability to extreme weather events, disaster management and adaptation must be part of long-term sustainable development planning in developing countries. Lending agencies and donors need to reform their investment policies in developing countries to focus more on capacity building instead of just investing in recovery operations and infrastructure development.},

Previous studies evaluating the factor structure of the FMPS have reported inconsistent findings. The study objective was to examine the psychometric properties of proposed four, five, and six factor solutions of the FMPS using Rasch analysis. Method Using the responses from a sample of New Zealand athletes and exercisers (n\,=\,425) from a variety of sports, we subjected the dataset to Rasch analysis. The overall and individual item fit, unidimensionality, local independence, and person separation reliability were evaluated by treating factors of each model as subtests. Results After disordered thresholds were uniformly rescored, the factor Organisation displayed significant misfit to the model across all three solutions tested. Removal of Organisation and combining two parental facets into one resulted in adequate model fit and good item discrimination ability for all three solutions. The modified six-factor model was the best in terms of reliability, with no differential item functioning and the highest person separation index. Conclusion The present results support the psychometric properties and internal structural validity of the rescored FMPS with the parental factors combined and without the Organisation facet. Psychometric properties of the instrument can be further enhanced by using the ordinal-to-interval conversion table presented here, which does not require modification of the original response format. These findings will be of interest in different areas where accurate assessment of the overall perfectionism trait is important and open new avenues for perfectionism research.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with the selection of subsets of predictor variables in a linear regression model for the prediction of a dependent variable. It is based on a Bayesian approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability distribution is first assigned to the dependent variable through the specification of a family of prior distributions for the unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere, that is, a ``spike and slab'' distribution. The random error component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation {$\sigma$}, where ln({$\sigma$}) has a locally uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior distribution depends only on the data and the parameter {$\gamma$}, which is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods. Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing {$\gamma$}, assessing the complexity of the response function and the strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following plots against {$\gamma$} are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e) posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that generates a predictive density for each observation, given all of the data except that observation, that is, a type of ``leave one out'' approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a specified level of significance. The dependence of the results on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are given to demonstrate the application of the methods.},

METHOD: Previous research has shown significantly higher levels of impulsivity among patients with conduct disorder, personality disorders, substance use disorders, and bipolar disorder, compared to other psychiatric patients or healthy comparison subjects. A literature review of the theoretical bases of the relationship between these disorders and impulsivity is presented. Measurements of impulsivity and treatment options are discussed in relation to the physiology of impulsivity and the disorders in which it is a prominent feature. RESULTS: Impulsivity, as defined on the basis of a biopsychosocial approach, is a key feature of several psychiatric disorders. Behavioral and pharmacological interventions that are effective for treating impulsivity should be incorporated into treatment plans for these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The high comorbidity of impulsivity and selected psychiatric disorders, including personality disorders, substance use disorders, and bipolar disorder, is in a large part related to the association between impulsivity and the biological substrates of these disorders. Before treatment studies on impulsivity can move forward, measures of impulsivity that capture the core aspects of this behavior need to be refined and tested on the basis of an ideologically neutral model of impulsivity.},

  abstract = {Natural scientists are increasingly interested in social research because they recognize that conservation problems are commonly social problems. Interpreting social research, however, requires at least a basic understanding of the philosophical principles and theoretical assumptions of the discipline, which are embedded in the design of social research. Natural scientists who engage in social science but are unfamiliar with these principles and assumptions can misinterpret their results. We developed a guide to assist natural scientists in understanding the philosophical basis of social science to support the meaningful interpretation of social research outcomes. The 3 fundamental elements of research are ontology, what exists in the human world that researchers can acquire knowledge about; epistemology, how knowledge is created; and philosophical perspective, the philosophical orientation of the researcher that guides her or his action. Many elements of the guide also apply to the natural sciences. Natural scientists can use the guide to assist them in interpreting social science research to determine how the ontological position of the researcher can influence the nature of the research; how the epistemological position can be used to support the legitimacy of different types of knowledge; and how philosophical perspective can shape the researcher's choice of methods and affect interpretation, communication, and application of results. The use of this guide can also support and promote the effective integration of the natural and social sciences to generate more insightful and relevant conservation research outcomes.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Seasonal variations of violence have been the subject of some controversy. Norway, situated between latitudes 58\{degrees\} and 72\{degrees\} N, has considerable seasonal variations of light and provides a good opportunity for studies of seasonality. METHOD: The monthly numbers of police reports of violent incidents in 1991-1997 were obtained for the entire Norwegian population of 4,450,000 inhabitants and separately for each of seven Norwegian cities at different latitudes. RESULTS: A total of 82,537 episodes of violence were recorded. There was a significant variation in violent incidents between months, with a minimum daily frequency of 28.7 in March and a maximum daily frequency of 35.1 in June. The frequency curve had one significant peak in May through June and another significant peak in October through November. The monthly frequency of violence correlated with the absolute value of monthly change in length of day from the previous month. In the seven cities the highest monthly ratio of observed to expected frequencies increased with latitude. With increasing latitude, the months with the largest increase in violence came later both in the spring and in the fall. CONCLUSIONS: There is a distinct pattern of seasonal variation in the frequency of violence that varies systematically with latitude. This pattern resembles the seasonal pattern of some forms of suicide, hospitalization for affective disorders, and mood and activity in the general population.},

Regrets more often focused on nonfixable than fixable situations. Women more than men reported love rather than work regrets and, overall, regrets more often focused on romance than on other life domains. Objective life circumstances (referenced by demographic variables) predicted regret in patterns consistent with regret regulation theory.

  abstract = {Epidemiology is the study of health and illness in human populations.62 Descriptive epidemiologic studies provide information on the scope and impact of disease by examining patterns of the occurrence and distribution of diseases and other health-related outcomes in populations according to sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, gender, race, social class, geographic area, and time.57 The data from such studies complement descriptive findings from clinical observations, basic research, and other sources of information, and are used to generate causal hypotheses. Causal hypotheses are tested in analytic epidemiologic studies, which examine the relationships between risk factors, or antecedent exposures, and health outcomes.62 A major contribution of epidemiologic studies of both clinical and community populations is not only to identify independent risk or protective factors, but also to quantify the strength of their relative contribution to the risk of disease or disorder.79 Epidemiology has played an important role in identifying and determining the potency of risk factors for complex outcomes such as suicide and suicidal behaviors. The past decade, for example, has seen the emergence of the psychological autopsy study as a powerful tool in the methodologic repertoire available to suicidologists. These highly rigorous, population-based studies have been invaluable both in verifying causal hypotheses generated from clinic-based observational studies, in providing additional data on completed suicide that are generalizable to the population, and in generating further causal hypotheses that can be tested by basic, clinical, and epidemiologic research. Similarly, epidemiologic surveys of unbiased samples are able to reach beyond the limits of clinical and other service settings to provide information on the scope of suicidal behaviors and risk factors in the general population. Because population-based research avoids the biases and lack of generalizability associated with nonepidemiologic studies of self-selected clinical populations, 32 and provides findings that are generalizable beyond the study sample, this review focuses primarily on the findings from recent psychological autopsy studies and epidemiologic surveys, particularly those that used standardized psychiatric criteria (e.g., DSM-III-R).1 Increasingly rigorous research efforts, such as the application of multivariate models to test causal hypotheses of both completed and attempted suicide, have expanded scientific understanding of the multiple, interrelated risk factors for suicide. A risk factor is a characteristic, variable, or hazard that increases the likelihood of development of an adverse outcome, 64 which is measurable, and which precedes the outcome.63 The crucial feature of precedence distinguishes risk factors from other characteristics such as concomitants or consequences of outcomes, which are correlates but not risk factors.63 The cause of a complex outcome such as suicidal behavior actually consists of a constellation of components that act together, 99 which vary from one individual to another. From an epidemiologic perspective, and taking into account the distinctive feature of antecedent occurrence, risk factors can be organized within a framework that differentiates between distal and proximal exposures. Distal risk factors represent the foundation upon which suicidal behavior is built. They represent a threshold that increases individual risk for later vulnerability to proximal risk factors. Distal risk factors are not limited to suicide, but can produce multiple adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Their relationship to suicide is fundamental but indirect; they are considered necessary, but not sufficient, for suicide to occur.99 Proximal risk factors, on the other hand, are more closely related temporally to the suicidal event itself, and can act as precipitants. Such ``triggering'' events are likely to differ with age, gender, ethnicity, and other sociodemographic factors. In and of themselves, proximal risk factors are neither necessary nor sufficient for suicide. The combination of powerful distal risk factors with proximal events and characteristics, however, can lead to the necessary and sufficient conditions for suicide. The conceptual distinction between distal and proximal risk factors assumes practical importance when planning prevention programs because the strategies used, and their potential effectiveness, are likely to differ depending on the nature of the targeted risk factors. On one hand, the complex nature of suicide suggests that complex and elaborate interventions are necessary for prevention; on the other hand, it implies that preventive and treatment interventions can be targeted and tested at a number of points in a theoretical model. Both distal and proximal risk factors can and do co-occur in individual, family, and environmental domains, and their co-occurrence is likely to be associated with the greatest risk for suicide.47,65,66,93,108,111,112,119 It is important to note that many individuals may have one or more risk factors and not be suicidal; on the other hand, the likelihood of suicide or suicidal behavior increases with an increasing number of risk factors.},

  abstract = {Since anthropogenic climate change first emerged on the public agenda in the mid-to-late 1980s, public communication of climate change and\textemdash more recently\textemdash the question of how to communicate it most effectively have witnessed a steep rise. This paper synthesizes what is known, presumed, and still unknown about how to effectively communicate this problem. An introductory historical overview of climate change communication is followed by a discussion of the challenges that communicators face in trying to convey the issue (invisibility of causes, distant impacts, lack of immediacy and direct experience of the impacts, lack of gratification for taking mitigative actions, disbelief in human's global influence, complexity and uncertainty, inadequate signals indicating the need for change, perceptual limits and self-interest). The core of the paper focuses on key aspects of the communication process (purpose and scope of the communication, audience, framing, messages, messengers, modes and channels of communication, and assessing the outcomes and effectiveness of a communication). These elements are placed in relationship to several contextual factors that affect the communication process. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research on climate change communication. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

Two explanations for the emergence of CTs are that they result from social marginalisation and a lack of agency, or that they are due to a need-to-explain-the-unexplained. Furthermore, representativeness heuristics may form reasoning biases that make such beliefs more likely. Two related studies (N=107; N=120) examined the relationships between these social marginalisation, intolerance of uncertainty, heuristics and CT belief using a correlational design. Overall, intolerance of uncertainty did not link strongly to CT belief, but worldview variables did \textemdash{} particularly a sense of the world as (socially) threatening, non-random, and with no fixed morality. The use of both representative heuristics that were examined was heightened in those participants more likely to endorse CTs. These factors seem to contribute to the likelihood of whether the individual will endorse CTs generally, relating similarly to common CTs, CTs generally historically accepted as ``true'', and to the endorsement of fictional CTs that the individual would find novel. Implications are discussed.},

The item step parameter of this model is decomposed to a location and a threshold parameter, following Andrich's (1978) rating scale formulation. The EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters is derived. The performance of this generalized model is compared on both simulated and real data to a Rasch family of polytomous item response models. Simulated data were generated and then analyzed by the various polytomous item response models. The results demonstrate that the rating formulation of the GPCM is quite adaptable to the analysis of polytomous item responses. The real data used in this study consisted of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (Johnson \& Allen, 1992) mathematics data that used both dichotomous and polytomous items. The PCM was applied to these data using both constant and varying slope parameters. The GPCM, which provides for varying slope parameters, yielded better fit to the data than did the PCM.},

Results revealed that the use of item parcels yielded more nonconverged solutions and Heywood cases than individual items. The likelihood of nonconverged solutions and Heywood cases increased as the number of indicators per factor (more items per parcel) decreased. Meanwhile, parcel solutions as compared with item solutions resulted in better fit as measured by the chi-square to degrees-of-freedom ratio, Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI), Expected Cross-Validation Index (ECVI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), as well as two incremental fit indices, the Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI) and Comparative Fit Index (CFI). The same pattern of results was found with data that varied in terms of skewness and kurtosis at the item level. However, the likelihood of nonconverged solutions and Heywood cases was more pronounced when data were extremely skewed/kurtotic at the item level.},

  abstract = {Health-related conspiracy theories can undermine the trustworthiness of actors and institutions and may impact an individual's intention to seek help. Across three experimental studies, we investigated the consequences of exposure to an antidepressant conspiracy theory on general intentions to seek medical and psychological help. Study 1 participants (N = 299) were randomly allocated to read one of three articles (pro-conspiracy, anti-conspiracy, control) after which they completed measures of conspiracy endorsement, trust, powerlessness, and health-seeking intentions. Results suggested that exposure to antidepressant conspiracy theories significantly reduced individual's intention to seek help indirectly through decreased trust in health authorities, but not health-industry-related powerlessness. In two additional pre-registered studies, we found some support for these findings. While Study 2 (N = 244) found no support for a direct or indirect relationship between conspiracy exposure and health-seeking intentions, an exploratory analysis highlighted the importance of gender differences when investigating conspiracy exposure on intentions. Study 3 (N = 247) replicated Study 1 findings, highlighting that antidepressant conspiracy theories decrease health-seeking intentions indirectly through decreased trust and increased powerlessness. Mere exposure to antidepressant conspiracy theories had significant indirect consequences on general health-seeking intentions.},

Navakatikyan's models performed better or on par with their competitors, especially in predicting residence-time data and generalized-matching sensitivities for time allocation. The models described well an observed decrease, in several of these data sets, in generalized-matching sensitivity between two alternatives when reinforcer rate increased on the other alternatives. Models built on the generalized-matching principle cannot do this. Navakatikyan's models also performed better, though to a lesser extent, than their competitors for data sets that are not obviously inconsistent with generalized matching.},

Traders adapt their beliefs about future temperatures based on the profits of other traders in their social network. We simulate two alternative climate futures, in which global temperatures are primarily driven either by carbon dioxide or by solar irradiance. These represent, respectively, the scientific consensus and a hypothesis advanced by prominent skeptics. We conduct sensitivity analyses to determine how a variety of factors describing both the market and the physical climate may affect traders' beliefs about the cause of global climate change. Market participation causes most traders to converge quickly toward believing the "true" climate model, suggesting that a climate market could be useful for building public consensus.},

This study supports this claim, demonstrating significantly greater gains in psychological resilience for 41 young adults participating in 22-day Outward Bound programs than in a control group. All Outward Bound participants reported positive changes in their resilience and their overall change effect size was large. Perceived levels of social support predicted 24\% of the variance in resilience gain scores, with participants' ratings of the least supportive group member being the best predictor. The findings for enhanced resilience and the important role of social support warrant wider investigation. In promoting psychological resilience adventure educators are alerted to the importance of facilitating positive interpersonal relations and minimising the detrimental impact of the diverse needs of group members.},

This paper presents a series of studies designed to investigate the reliability and validity of the empathizing and systemizing quotients (EQ \& SQ), to relate them to existing personality constructs, and to replicate reported sex and sexual orientation-related differences. Correlations with interests and social behaviour suggest the two measures are valid. However, empathizing appears essentially equivalent to agreeableness in the five-factor model of personality. Systemizing cannot be reduced to established personality dimensions, though it is moderately correlated with conscientiousness and openness. Men have higher levels of systemizing than women, and non-heterosexual women higher than heterosexuals. However, no differences were found between heterosexual and non-heterosexual men. Although systemizing and empathizing account for a number of observed sex differences, there are others they do not explain.},

One approach argues that the affective mechanisms that are dysregulated in depression are adaptations, whilst a second approach argues that depression itself is an adaptation. The evidence relating to whether depression could itself be an adaptation is reviewed. Adaptations generally have four hallmarks; they lack heritable variation, show evidence of good design, are evoked by appropriate triggers, and fitness is reduced where they are absent. Depression shows none of these hallmarks. It is characterized by heritability, recurrence, cognitive impairment, and poor social outcome. In an alternative evolutionary formulation, I argue that evolution has produced a continuous population distribution of affective reactivity that is subject to stabilizing selection. Individuals vulnerable to depression are at the upper end of this distribution. This conceptualization, in which depression itself is not selected for, is compatible with the known clinical and epidemiological facts.},

In the present study we studied five women in summer and six women in winter and evaluated possible differences in availability of brain serotonin transporters between summer and winter. Methods: We employed the single photon emission computed tomography ligand [123I]-2[beta]-carbomethoxy-3[beta]-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([123I][beta]-CIT) to visualize binding to the serotonin transporter site in the human thalamus/hypothalamus midbrain area in vivo. Brain imaging studies were performed in one group between May and August and in the other between November and December. Results: We found significant differences in displaceable [123I][beta]-CIT binding in the region corresponding to thalamus/hypothalamus between the summer group and the winter group (1.9 {$\pm$} 0.3 vs. 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.2, respectively; p {$<$} .01). Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest reduced brain serotonin transporter availability in winter. This finding further substantiates evidence of seasonal variations in brain serotonergic function.},

Results were consistent with the dual-process claim: The executive burden hampered correct reasoning when the believability of a conclusion conflicted with its logical validity, but not when beliefs cued the correct response. However, although participants with high working memory spans performed better than those with lower spans in cases of a conflict, all reasoners showed similar effects of load. The findings support the idea that there are two reasoning systems with differential processing demands, but constitute evidence against qualitative individual differences in the human reasoning machinery.},

However, random differences may remain if the sample size is insufficiently large. We sought to determine the minimal sample size required to eliminate random differences, thereby allowing an unbiased estimation of the treatment effect. Study Design and Setting We reanalyzed two published multicenter, large, and simple trials: the International Stroke Trial (IST) and the Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) Off- or On-Pump Revascularization Study (CORONARY). We reiterated 1,000 times the analysis originally reported by the investigators in random samples of varying size. We measured the covariates balance across the treatment arms. We estimated the effect of aspirin and heparin on death or dependency at 30~days after stroke (IST), and the effect of off-pump CABG on a composite primary outcome of death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or new renal failure requiring dialysis at 30~days (CORONARY). In addition, we conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations of randomized trials to supplement these analyses. Results Randomization removes random differences between treatment groups when including at least 1,000 participants, thereby resulting in minimal bias in effects estimation. Later, substantial bias is observed. In a short review, we show such an enrollment is achieved in 41.5\% of phase 3 trials published in the highest impact medical journals. Conclusions Conclusions drawn from completely randomized trials enrolling a few participants may not be reliable. In these circumstances, alternatives such as minimization or blocking should be considered for allocating the treatment.},

Meade and Craig (2012) and Huang, Curran, Keeney, Poposki, and DeShon (2012) discussed methods to detect unmotivated or careless respondents in large web-based questionnaires. We first discuss these methods and present multi-test extensions of person-fit statistics as alternatives. Second, we applied these methods to data collected through a web-based questionnaire, in which some respondents received instructions to respond quickly which can result in more careless responding. In addition, we conducted a simulation study. We compared sensitivity and specificity of different methods and concluded that multi-test extensions of person-fit statistics are a good alternative as compared to other methods, although the sensitivity to detect careless respondents using empirical data was lower than using simulated data.},

The major limitation of this approach is that attitudes do not always translate into behavior and therefore may not provide an accurate assessment of program success. Given that achieving conservation goals generally relies on understanding and changing human behavior, we argue for the need to assess behavior rather than attitudes as an indicator of conservation outcomes. Psychological theory shows that attitudes and behavior are distinct, but related, concepts. Measuring conservation behaviors involves identifying the target behavior or behaviors and the optimal time to measure and then selecting the most appropriate method of measurement (i.e., direct observation, objective indicators, self-reported behavior, and behavioral intentions) that considers the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We call for conservation programs to focus on influencing behavior rather than attitudes alone and encourage conservation practitioners and researchers to collect high-quality behavioral data to more effectively inform policy and programs.},

Analysis of variance among the three majors found the differences in 10 personality factors to be significant and a multivariate analysis of variance determined gender a significant covariate. While this research provides a detailed personality profile unique for each major, stepwise discriminant analysis isolated one personality factor providing a predictive model of 42.8\% while gender contributed 5.1\% for a predictive psychometric model of 47.9\%.

However, the causal chains suggested in the literature have so far rarely been substantiated with reliable evidence. Given the combined uncertainties of climate and conflict research, the gaps in our knowledge about the consequences of climate change for conflict and security appear daunting.

While some nations have done better than others, no nation has adequately reduced emissions and no nation has a base of public citizens that are sufficiently socially and politically engaged in response to climate change. This paper summarizes international and national differences in levels of knowledge and concern regarding climate change, and the existing explanations for the worldwide failure of public response to climate change, drawing from psychology, social psychology and sociology. On the whole, the widely presumed links between public access to information on climate change and levels of concern and action are not supported. The paper's key findings emphasize the presence of negative emotions in conjunction with global warming (fear, guilt, and helplessness), and the process of emotion management and cultural norms in the construction of a social reality in which climate change is held at arms length. Barriers in responding to climate change are placed into three broad categories: 1) psychological/conceptual, 2) social and cultural, and 3) structural (political economy). The author provides policy considerations and summarizes the policy implications of both psychological and conceptual barriers, and social and cultural barriers.

Meeting the mental health needs of children, women, and survivors in developing countries is particularly critical. The family context is central to understanding and meeting those needs. Because of the complexity of disasters and responses to them, interagency cooperation and coordination are extremely important elements of the mental health response.

As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results.

When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive\textemdash getting it right\textemdash competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive\textemdash getting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.},

One set of recommendations emphasizes the need for examining and optimizing the psychometric properties of relevant measurement paradigms from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. This step is critical to translating many notable advances in these basic fields into measures that would be appropriate for clinical trials. A second set of recommendations focuses on key directions for the development and application of animal models of cognitive processes that would greatly aid the discovery and preclinical testing of potential cognition-enhancing agents. As part of this process, the group noted several existing animal paradigms that have particular promise as measures in the key cognitive domains in schizophrenia identified by the MATRICS Neurocognition Committee.},

In line with earlier research, we found that half of all published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called ``co-pilot model,'' and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one's own manuscript or during the review process.},

Recent research has shown that more numerate people can be more polarized about these topics despite their better ability to interpret the scientific data. In this study, we investigated whether the motivated numeracy effect originally found by Kahan, Peters, Dawson, and Slovic [2017. Motivated numeracy and enlightened self-government. Behavioural Public Policy, 1(1)] on the controversial topic of gun control laws in the United States also applies to people when assessing ACC risks. This randomized controlled experiment (N = 504) of Australian adults extends the motivated reasoning thesis by finding evidence that highly numerate people who receive scientific data about ACC use motivated numeracy to rationalize their interpretations in line with their attitudes.},

In Experiments 2a and 2b, children aged 6\textendash 7 who experienced regret decided adaptively more often than children who did not experience regret, and this held even when controlling for age and verbal ability. Experiment 3 ruled out a memory-based interpretation of these findings. These findings suggest that the experience of regret facilitates children's ability to learn rapidly from bad outcomes.},

A total of 40 laboratories collected data for this project, and 23 of these laboratories met all inclusion criteria.

In contrast with many theoretical speculations, we do not find conspiracism to be a product of greater authoritarianism, ignorance, or political conservatism. Rather, the likelihood of supporting conspiracy theories is strongly predicted by a willingness to believe in other unseen, intentional forces and an attraction to Manichean narratives. These findings both demonstrate the widespread allure of conspiracy theories as political explanations and offer new perspectives on the forces that shape mass opinion and American political culture.},

Their attribution of universalism is exaggerated; what they are seeing is actually a desire to unify different selected areas, a basic goal in theoretical explanation. One advantage of rational choice models is that they frequently make precise predictions. Models that can do this offer an escape from the uninformative ritual of null hypotheses tests.},

  abstract = {Research has documented that most college students delay on academic tasks. Surprisingly, graduate students may procrastinate on academic tasks even more than do undergraduate students. Perfectionism also has been found to be high among graduate students. It is likely that for graduate students, delaying academic tasks such as writing a term paper is indicative of perfectionism. Thus, this study investigated the relationship between academic procrastination and perfectionism among 135 graduate students, who were administered the Procrastination Assessment Scale-Students and the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale. A canonical correlation analysis revealed that fear of failure, a component of academic procrastination, was related to self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism. Other-oriented perfectionism, the third dimension of perfectionism, acted as a suppressor variable. Implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Data were obtained by means of a survey of 1,959 Dutch adults, 18\textendash 93~yr of age. Phobias were assessed based on DSM-IV-TR criteria, whereas severity of present fears was assessed using visual analogue scales. The prevalence of dental fear was 24.3\%, which is lower than for fear of snakes (34.8\%), heights (30.8\%), and physical injuries (27.2\%). Among phobias, dental phobia was the most common (3.7\%), followed by height phobia (3.1\%) and spider phobia (2.7\%). Fear of dental treatment was associated with female gender, rated as more severe than any other fear, and was most strongly associated with intrusive re-experiencing (49.4\%). The findings suggest that dental fear is a remarkably severe and stable condition with a long duration. The high prevalence of dental phobia in the Netherlands is intriguing and warrants investigation in other countries.},

Data from Slovenia were investigated to further evaluate the links between suicide rates and seasonal amplitude.Methods A total of 14 325 male suicides and 4350 female suicides occurring in Slovenia from 1971 to 2002 were investigated with harmonic spectral analysis to extract their monthly seasonal dispersion by eight-year intervals. Changes in rate over time were analysed with a test for trend based on regression analysis.Results The suicide rates of both males and females increased over time, with an evident peak in the 1987-1994 period and a decrease thereafter. Seasonality decreased across time in both sexes; however, no change of the peak was observed over time. The amplitude of the major 12-month cycle was slightly positively related to suicide rates, but the correlation was only statistically significant among females (P = 0.0053; males: P = 0.22).Limitations Data could not be analysed according to age, the method of suicide, or the diagnosis attributable to the deceased, since this information was not available.Conclusion The study confirmed that the seasonal effect on mortality by suicide is positively related to suicide rates, so much so that changes in suicide rates over time correspond to changes in suicide seasonality, but in Slovenia this effect was only evident among females, further pointing towards differences by sex in the mechanics leading to suicide.},

Through ten detailed case studies, it explores society's efforts to generate reliable scientific information about complex natural systems and to use that information in making sound policy decisions. The book: provides an overview of predictive science from historical, scientific, political, and behavioral perspectives offers case studies of the use and misuse of scientific predictions on subjects ranging from asteroids to nuclear waste disposal proposes a practical analytical framework for the use of predictive science in setting policy recommends actions and policies that can increase the likelihood of effective decisions Contributors include Clark Chapman, Charles Herrick, William H.

  abstract = {Purpose. To assess how upper limb amputation affects mental health and life satisfaction.Method. Cross-sectional study comparing the mental health and perceived satisfaction with life among adult acquired major upper limb amputees in Norway with a control group drawn from the Norwegian general population. The scales used were the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and the Hopkins Symptom Check List 25-item (SCL-25). The groups were compared using multiple linear regression analyses.Results. The amputees scored significantly lower on life satisfaction than the control group. A tendency to poorer mental health in the amputee group was observed, but there was no clear evidence of such a difference. The amputation effect on life satisfaction seemed to be mediated mainly by changes in occupational status and by the occurrence of short- or long-term complications related to the amputation.Conclusions. Our findings imply that rehabilitation of upper limb amputees should emphasise facilitating return to work as well as the prevention of short- and long-term complications, and that this will be of importance not only for the amputees' physical function, but for the maintenance of acceptable life satisfaction. Further studies on the effect of upper limb amputation on mental health are recommended.},

Understanding how stigma affects family members in terms of both their psychological response to the ill person and their contacts with psychiatric services will improve interactions with the family. Aims To investigate factors of psychological significance related to stigma of the relatives. Method In a Swedish multi-centre study, 162 relatives of patients in acute psychiatric wards following both voluntary and compulsory admissions were interviewed concerning psychological factors related to stigma. Results A majority of relatives experienced psychological factors of stigma by association. Eighteen per cent of the relatives had at times thought that the patient would be better off dead, and 10\% had experienced suicidal thoughts. Stigma by association was greater in relatives experiencing mental health problems of their own, and was unaffected by patient background characteristics. Conclusions Interventions are needed to reduce the negative effects of psychological factors related to stigma by association in relatives of people with mental illness.},

Regression analyses showed that personal but not general BJW was negatively associated with anxiety, depression and general psychological distress. This pattern of results persisted when controlled for age, sex, substantial stressors and losses caused by the flood. Contrary to our expectations, BJW did not reveal an association with posttraumatic symptomatology, which is interpreted by referring to recent models of cognitive processing in PTSD. Overall, our results support the assertion that BJW buffers mental health.},

Whether and to what extent this event is attributable to anthropogenic climate change is controversial. Dole et al. (2011) report the 2010 Russian heat wave was ``mainly natural in origin'' whereas Rahmstorf and Coumou (2011) write that with a probability of 80\% ``the 2010 July heat record would not have occurred'' without the large-scale climate warming since 1980, most of which has been attributed to the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. The latter explicitly state that their results ``contradict those of Dole et al. (2011).'' Here we use the results from a large ensemble simulation experiment with an atmospheric general circulation model to show that there is no substantive contradiction between these two papers, in that the same event can be both mostly internally-generated in terms of magnitude and mostly externally-driven in terms of occurrence-probability. The difference in conclusion between these two papers illustrates the importance of specifying precisely what question is being asked in addressing the issue of attribution of individual weather events to external drivers of climate.},

One of the hallmarks of this text is the positive feedback from students-even students who are not mathematically inclined praise the text for its clarity, detailed presentation, and use of humor to help make concepts accessible and memorable. Thorough explanations precede the introduction of every formula-and the exercises that immediately follow include a step-by-step model that lets students compare their work against fully solved examples.

  abstract = {Interest in attributing the risk of damaging weather-related events to anthropogenic climate change is increasing. Yet climate models used to study the attribution problem typically do not resolve the weather systems associated with damaging events such as the UK floods of October and November 2000. Occurring during the wettest autumn in England and Wales since records began in 1766, these floods damaged nearly 10,000 properties across that region, disrupted services severely, and caused insured losses estimated at \textsterling 1.3 billion (refs 5, 6). Although the flooding was deemed a `wake-up call' to the impacts of climate change at the time, such claims are typically supported only by general thermodynamic arguments that suggest increased extreme precipitation under global warming, but fail to account fully for the complex hydrometeorology associated with flooding. Here we present a multi-step, physically based `probabilistic event attribution' framework showing that it is very likely that global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions substantially increased the risk of flood occurrence in England and Wales in autumn 2000. Using publicly volunteered distributed computing, we generate several thousand seasonal-forecast-resolution climate model simulations of autumn 2000 weather, both under realistic conditions, and under conditions as they might have been had these greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting large-scale warming never occurred. Results are fed into a precipitation-runoff model that is used to simulate severe daily river runoff events in England and Wales (proxy indicators of flood events). The precise magnitude of the anthropogenic contribution remains uncertain, but in nine out of ten cases our model results indicate that twentieth-century anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions increased the risk of floods occurring in England and Wales in autumn 2000 by more than 20\%, and in two out of three cases by more than 90\%.},

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated 2 second-order factors: One was more closely related to anxiety and the other was more closely related to negative attitudes toward statistics. Predictive validity of the STARS was shown both in an experimental exam-like situation in the laboratory and during a real examination situation. Taken together, the findings indicate that statistics anxiety as assessed by the STARS is a useful construct that is more than just an expression of a more general disposition to anxiety.},

Mere communication campaigns, which are often alarmist, are widely used despite their uncertain effectiveness. We suggest that using binding communication strategies would prove more adequate. Binding communication consists in combining a persuasive message and a preparatory act linked to the persuasive message. This procedure is generally reported to be more efficient than a single persuasive message at influencing attitudes and behavior. This hypothesis was tested in a study in which students were presented with a classic climate change communication with/without a preparatory act (participant-proposed solutions). Results showed that although knowledge about climate change increased in both conditions, attitudes and behavior follow-through were positively affected only in the binding communication condition. Therefore, in addressing climate change and global warming behaviors, pairing a persuasive message with personal solution generation is a potentially valid and useful technique.},

The techniques were assayed by applying them to a set of 50 single-case AB design (baseline and intervention) data sets, constructed to represent a range of type and degree of intervention effects. From analysis of these 50 data sets, four questions were answered about the analytic techniques: (a) How much statistical power is possessed by the more promising techniques? (b) What typical R2 effect sizes are evidenced for graphed data sets which, according to visual analysis, show a positive intervention effect? (c) How do the five analytic techniques covary with one another? and (d) To what extent does each technique tend to produce autocorrelated residuals?},

The study found moderate agreement (56\textendash 74\%) of visual significance among a panel of five judges. The judges also detected a rather low proportion (48\%) of significant differences between the adjacent phases of published graphs. A randomization test was applied to a subset (n = 15) of the graphs and found statistical significance between only four of the adjacent phases. Considerable agreement (80\%) was found between the visual inspection and statistical procedures, although most of it involved agreement of the nonsignificance of treatment effects. It was recommended that future single-case research jointly utilize visual and statistical procedures when determining significance. It was also suggested that future research in the field examine graphs with multiple phases, baselines, and participants.},

The daily data on the number of suicides, and the mean and maximum levels of geomagnetic activity were compiled and modelled with Poisson regression using the number of inhabitants in each province as the denominator.

Results: There was a strong seasonal effect on suicide occurrence (P{$<$}0.00001), the risk of suicide being greatest in spring. The seasonal effect was most pronounced when the number of suicides was relatively low. High levels of solar radiation activity were associated with the increased risk of suicide (P=0.00001), but the effect of geomagnetic activity was weak. Limitations: No individual data on alcohol consumption or mental disorders were available. Conclusions: Suicide occurrence varies markedly by season and needs attention where prevention is concerned.},

Daily data on the number of suicides, local weather conditions and geomagnetic storms were compiled and modelled with Poisson regression using the province population as the denominator, and with the means of harmonic series for seasonal variation. Time series analysis of monthly numbers of suicides was carried out using the seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess. Results: Marked fluctuations in the number of suicides occurred during the study period (P=0.01). There was significant seasonal variation in death from suicide (P=0.01), but analysis of the meteorological data showed no evidence of effect on the risk of suicide. Limitations: Assessment of mental disorder or alcohol consumption was missing, since only data derived from death certificate was available for each case. Conclusions: The seasonal effect was significant, but remained modest compared to sex and age as risk factors for suicide. Preventive measures need to be tailored according to time of the year.},

We linked versatile information on each individual to meteorological data adjusted for local weather conditions, and to the universal astronomic data.Results:~ The number of suicides with seasonal mismatch was greater than the expected in the northernmost region of the country (P~=~0.03). The northern location was the most significant predictor of such suicides (P~=~0.001). They were associated with the changes in ambient temperature during the preceding day (P~\&lt;~0.00001), the changes to colder preceding suicides in the spring.Conclusion:~ Our findings show that mismatch between the changes in ambient temperature and those in the length of day may precede death from suicide in some individuals.},

  abstract = {The term ``learning styles'' refers to the concept that individuals differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech) and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment instruments are extremely diverse. The most common\textemdash but not the only\textemdash hypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner (e.g., for a ``visual learner,'' emphasizing visual presentation of information)., The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and many organizations offer professional development workshops for teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles., The authors of the present review were charged with determining whether these practices are supported by scientific evidence. We concluded that any credible validation of learning-styles-based instruction requires robust documentation of a very particular type of experimental finding with several necessary criteria. First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style., Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis., We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all. Further research on the use of learning-styles assessment in instruction may in some cases be warranted, but such research needs to be performed appropriately.},

  abstract = {Assessments of climate change face the task of making information about uncertainty accessible and useful to decision-makers. The literature in behavior economics provides many examples of how people make decisions under conditions of uncertainty relying on inappropriate heuristics, leading to inconsistent and counterproductive choices. Modern risk communication practices recommend a number of methods to overcome these hurdles, which have been recommended for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports. This paper evaluates the success of the most recent IPCC approach to uncertainty communication, based on a controlled survey of climate change experts. Evaluating the results from the survey, and from a similar survey recently conducted among university students, the paper suggests that the most recent IPCC approach leaves open the possibility for biased and inconsistent responses to the information. The paper concludes by suggesting ways to improve the approach for future IPCC assessment reports. To cite this article: A. Patt, S. Dessai, C. R. Geoscience 337 (2005).},

Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. Uncertainty remains in attributing the expansion or resurgence of diseases to climate change, owing to lack of long-term, high-quality data sets as well as the large influence of socio-economic factors and changes in immunity and drug resistance. Here we review the growing evidence that climate\textendash health relationships pose increasing health risks under future projections of climate change and that the warming trend over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in many regions of the world. Potentially vulnerable regions include the temperate latitudes, which are projected to warm disproportionately, the regions around the Pacific and Indian oceans that are currently subjected to large rainfall variability due to the El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation sub-Saharan Africa and sprawling cities where the urban heat island effect could intensify extreme climatic events.},

Life satisfaction as assessed by the SWLS shows a degree of temporal stability (e.g., .54 for 4 yrs), yet the SWLS has shown sufficient sensitivity to be potentially valuable to detect change in life satisfaction during the course of clinical intervention. Further, the scale shows discriminant validity from emotional well-being measures. The SWLS is recommended as a complement to scales that focus on psychopathology or emotional well-being because it assesses an individual's conscious evaluative judgment of his or her life by using the person's own criteria.},

This contribution aims to remind readers what power analysis is, emphasize why it matters, and articulate when and how it should be used. The focus is on applications of power analysis for experimental designs often encountered in psychology, starting from simple two-group independent and paired groups and moving to one-way analysis of variance, factorial designs, contrast analysis, trend analysis, regression analysis, analysis of covariance, and mediation analysis. Special attention is given to the application of power analysis to moderation designs, considering both dichotomous and continuous predictors and moderators. Illustrative practical examples based on G*Power and R packages are provided throughout the article. Annotated code for the examples with R and dedicated computational tools are made freely available at a dedicated web page (https://github.com/mcfanda/primerPowerIRSP). Applications of power analysis for more complex designs are briefly mentioned, and some important general issues related to power analysis are discussed.},

One contention is that differences in violence across communities of varying race-ethnic compositions are rooted in highly differentiated social and economic circumstances of the segregated neighborhoods inhabited by whites, African Americans, Latinos, and other groups. Here, the authors draw upon and expand this perspective by exploring how inequality in the character of internal and nearby neighborhood conditions leads to patterned racial and ethnic differences in violence across areas. Using data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study to examine the racial-spatial dynamic of violence for neighborhoods in thirty-six U.S. cities, the authors demonstrate that along with the social and economic conditions that exist within neighborhoods, proximity to more disadvantaged and especially racially privileged (heavily white) areas is particularly critical in accounting for the large and visible differences in violence found across neighborhoods of different colors.},

In a web-based experiment, we find evidence for a systematic backfire effect that occurs after a few minutes and strengthens after five days. Results show that forming judgments immediately during reception (in contrast to memory-based) can reduce backfire effects and prevent erroneous memory from affecting participants' attitudes.},

Sixty-two people wrote about an autobiographical experience of exclusion or inclusion. Then they repeated a swear or neutral word for 2 minutes followed by measures of social and physical pain. Excluded non-swearers reported feeling more social pain and greater sensitivity to physical pain compared with included non-swearers. Excluded swearers reported less social pain than excluded non-swearers and no heightened sensitivity to physical pain. The findings suggest that social and physical pain are functionally similar and that swearing attenuates social pain.},

Correcting for the effects of extraneous variables, such as seasons and days of the week, we found that suicides dropped by an annual average of -102.5 in the period surrounding the holidays. One set of holidays (Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas) was associated with an unusually low risk of suicide before, during, and after the holiday. Another set of holidays (New Year's Day, July 4th, and Labor Day) was associated with a low risk of suicide before the holiday and a high risk just afterwards. Almost all demographic groups experienced a low risk of suicide around the holidays: whites, blacks, males, females, retired persons, and persons of working age. Only white teenagers deviated from this pattern. Thus, the evidence does not support the widespread popular assumption that holidays are a risk factor in suicide.},

Understanding what the public knows about COVID-19 and identifying beliefs based on misinformation can help shape effective public health communications to ensure efforts to reduce viral transmission are not undermined.  Objective:  This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with COVID-19 misinformation in Australia and their changes over time.  Methods:  This prospective, longitudinal national survey was completed by adults (18 years and above) across April (n=4362), May (n=1882), and June (n=1369) 2020.  Results:  Stronger agreement with misinformation was associated with younger age, male gender, lower education level, and language other than English spoken at home ( P \&lt;.01 for all). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated ( P \&lt;.001) with lower levels of digital health literacy, perceived threat of COVID-19, confidence in government, and trust in scientific institutions. Analyses of specific government-identified misinformation revealed 3 clusters: prevention (associated with male gender and younger age), causation (associated with lower education level and greater social disadvantage), and cure (associated with younger age). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with stronger agreement with COVID-19 misinformation.  Conclusions:  The findings of this study highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness, which must be addressed to ensure effective COVID-19 prevention.

  abstract = {A major challenge facing climate scientists is explaining to non-specialists the risks and uncertainties surrounding potential changes over the coming years, decades and centuries. Although there are many guidelines for climate communication, there is little empirical evidence of their efficacy, whether for dispassionately explaining the science or for persuading people to act in more sustainable ways. Moreover, climate communication faces new challenges as assessments of climate-related changes confront uncertainty more explicitly and adopt risk-based approaches to evaluating impacts. Given its critical importance, public understanding of climate science deserves the strongest possible communications science to convey the practical implications of large, complex, uncertain physical, biological and social processes. Here, we identify the communications science that is needed to meet this challenge and the ambitious, interdisciplinary initiative that its effective application to climate science requires.},

Moreover, this inconsistency effect is specific to the emotion of regret, mediated by the judged quality of the decision process, independent of the valence of the decision outcomes, and, importantly, disappears when the quality of the decision process is high because inconsistency is justified. This provides new insights into regret's role in the action sequence, and has implications for decision justification theory, and action/inaction research.},

(For this reason, "cock-up" theories cannot in general replace conspiracy theories, since in many cases the cock-ups are simply failed conspiracies.) Why then is it silly to suppose that historical events are sometimes due to conspiracy? The only argument available to this author is drawn from the work of the late Sir Karl Popper, who criticizes what he calls "the conspiracy theory of society" in The Open Society and elsewhere. His critique of the conspiracy theory is indeed sound, but it is a theory no sane person maintains. Moreover, its falsehood is compatible with the prevalence of conspiracies. Nor do his arguments create any presumption against conspiracy theories of this or that. Thus the belief that it is superstitious to posit conspiracies is itself a superstition. The article concludes with some speculations as to why this superstition is so widely believed.},

Children aged 7-14 years (n=120) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: distraction, sensory-focussing or control (no imagery). The distraction condition prompted children to focus their attention externally; the sensory-focussing condition prompted the child to focus internally on physical sensations. Self-report measures of pain coping style preferences and imagery ability were completed. Children's pain tolerance and perceptions of pain intensity were assessed using a 10  \textdegree C cold-pressor task. Results showed pain intensity ratings after 1 min were lower for both intervention conditions than for the controls. Younger children (7-9 years) showed higher pain tolerance in the distraction condition than in the sensory-focussing condition, whereas both interventions were equally effective for older children (10-14 years). Among older children, coping style interacted with the intervention type: in the sensory-focussing condition, pain tolerance was negatively associated with self-reported distraction-based coping style, whereas in the distraction condition this association was positive. The results are interpreted with reference to current models of attention. The implications for use of attentional strategies in helping children to cope with clinical pain are discussed.},

The Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) is a self-report questionnaire, based on neuroethological considerations, that could help to assess emotional endophenotypes related to the activity in 6 core cerebral emotional systems (FEAR, ANGER, SADNESS, CARING, PLAYFULNESS, SEEKING). We further investigated its psychometric properties among 830 young adults and showed that they were satisfactory. As participants also completed several other self-reports that shared potential traits with the ANPS, we offer new validity evidence based on relations to other variables. We also provide additional evidence to consider that the ANPS scores can be validly interpreted for the characterization of emotional endophenotypes involved in a variety of psychiatric disorders. On the grounds of present results, of previous clinical studies, as well as some preliminary neuroimaging findings, we discuss new steps in the ANPS validation.},

Much emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. The NLME library for analyzing mixed-effects models in S and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented. This balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes the book a useful reference for practitioners who use, or intend to use, mixed-effects models in their data analyses.

We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28\% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45\%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47\% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18\% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.},

A total sample of 176 adult participants, from various settings, was assessed with a set of matrix tasks that involved either visuospatial (fluid) or semantic (crystallized) reasoning. The internal consistency was acceptable ({$\alpha$}\,=\,.748), and there was good four-week test\textendash retest reliability (r\,=\,.931). Concurrent validity was demonstrated by a high correlation between the new test and the (seven-subtest version) Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) scores (r\,=\,.889). A principal component analysis also suggested that the new test measures the same latent construct as the WAIS-IV\textemdash thought to be general intelligence. Predictive validity was shown in a subsample of 60 undergraduates by a medium-sized correlation between test scores and grade point average data (r\,=\,.396). These preliminary results suggest that the Matrix Matching Test may be a useful research tool.},

Beliefs in the autism/vaccines link and in vaccines side effects, along with intention to vaccinate a future child, were evaluated both immediately after the correction intervention and after a 7-day delay to reveal possible backfire effects. Results show that existing strategies to correct vaccine misinformation are ineffective and often backfire, resulting in the unintended opposite effect, reinforcing ill-founded beliefs about vaccination and reducing intentions to vaccinate. The implications for research on vaccines misinformation and recommendations for progress are discussed.},

We report a meta-analysis of twin correlations and reported variance components for 17,804 traits from 2,748 publications including 14,558,903 partly dependent twin pairs, virtually all published twin studies of complex traits. Estimates of heritability cluster strongly within functional domains, and across all traits the reported heritability is 49\%. For a majority (69\%) of traits, the observed twin correlations are consistent with a simple and parsimonious model where twin resemblance is solely due to additive genetic variation. The data are inconsistent with substantial influences from shared environment or non-additive genetic variation. This study provides the most comprehensive analysis of the causes of individual differences in human traits thus far and will guide future gene-mapping efforts. All the results can be visualized using the MaTCH webtool.},

  abstract = {Using the Internet during work time for personal interest is defined as personal web use (PWU), yet only limited knowledge is available on why people engage in varying degrees in this activity. To address this shortcoming, this research project tested a heavily moderated theoretical model of thirteen psychological and workplace attributes expected to influence differences in individuals' PWU: moral norms, boredom, workgroup norms, workload, use of the `ledger neutralisation strategy', certainty about PWU rules, attitude towards work, reactance, supervisor treatment, attitude towards PWU control, status, tenure and social loafing risk. Five facets of PWU were measured as separate criterion variables: past frequency, habitual PWU, duration, and two PWU activity types. Data for the model testing was gathered through an extensive on-line questionnaire. The responses of 267 participants with varying demographics and work situations were used to test the theoretical model, using moderated regression analyses. Significant interactions were explored further through the Modgraph procedure. The model testing results showed that PWU was more common in respondents who morally approved of PWU and who were bored at their work. How often people engaged in PWU (either out of habit or in general), for how long and in what types of activities, was influenced by specific combinations of the remaining attributes. Only four of the hypothesised twelve interactions played statistically significant roles, only habitual PWU was influenced by workload; and only information-seeking activities were influenced by workgroup norms. Attributes with `revenge' connotations were noticeably absent as significant influences. The findings are discussed in some detail. To further explore the context of PWU, thematic analysis was undertaken of answers to two open-response questions provided by a sub-sample of 119 participants. Results supported the role of workplace boredom in PWU situations, specified the moral issues of PWU approval, and suggested that PWU is best understood and examined in the wider context of organisational culture. The thesis concludes with synthesis and discussion of statistical and qualitative analyses results, identifying the contributions the research has made to the field of study. Suggested practical applications of the findings, limitations of the research project and suggestions for future studies conclude the documentation.},

  abstract = {It is the position of the American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine that physical activity, athletic performance, and recovery from exercise are enhanced by optimal nutrition. These organizations recommend appropriate selection of food and fluids, timing of intake, and supplement choices for optimal health and exercise performance. This position paper reviews the current scientific data related to the energy needs of athletes, assessment of body composition, strategies for weight change, the nutrient and fluid needs of athletes, special nutrient needs during training, the use of supplements and nutritional ergogenic aids, and the nutrition recommendations for vegetarian athletes. During times of high physical activity, energy and macronutrient needs\textemdash especially carbohydrate and protein intake\textemdash must be met in order to maintain body weight, replenish glycogen stores, and provide adequate protein for building and repair of tissue. Fat intake should be adequate to provide the essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins, as well as to help provide adequate energy for weight maintenance. Overall, diets should provide moderate amounts of energy from fat (20\% to 25\% of energy); however, there appears to be no health or performance benefit to consuming a diet containing less than 15\% of energy from fat. Body weight and composition can affect exercise performance, but should not be used as the sole criterion for sports performance; daily weigh-ins are discouraged. Consuming adequate food and fluid before, during, and after exercise can help maintain blood glucose during exercise, maximize exercise performance, and improve recovery time. Athletes should be well-hydrated before beginning to exercise; athletes should also drink enough fluid during and after exercise to balance fluid losses. Consumption of sport drinks containing carbohydrates and electrolytes during exercise will provide fuel for the muscles, help maintain blood glucose and the thirst mechanism, and decrease the risk of dehydration or hyponatremia. Athletes will not need vitamin and mineral supplements if adequate energy to maintain body weight is consumed from a variety of foods. However, supplements may be required by athletes who restrict energy intake, use severe weight-loss practices, eliminate one or more food groups from their diet, or consume high-carbohydrate diets with low micronutrient density. Nutritional ergogenic aids should be used with caution, and only after careful evaluation of the product for safety, efficacy, potency, and whether or not it is a banned or illegal substance. Nutrition advice, by a qualified nutrition expert, should only be provided after carefully reviewing the athlete's health, diet, supplement and drug use, and energy requirements.

Early-onset dental fear was related to conditioning experiences (indexed via caries level and tooth loss), service use patterns, stress reactive personality and specific beliefs about health professionals. Late-onset dental fear was related to aversive conditioning experiences, irregular service use and an external locus of control. In contrast to recent findings for dental anxiety, personality factors were not strongly related to the onset of dental fear in young adulthood. The key role played by conditioning events in the development of both early- and late-onset dental fear was confirmed. Conditioning events appear to play a different role in the development of dental fear vs dental anxiety. This may reflect important, but largely ignored differences between these two closely-related constructs. Interventions for early-onset dental fear should aim to modify both the dental fear and the personality vulnerabilities that may contribute to the development of dental fear early in the life-course.

I argue that the extent of the consensus does matter, most of all because scholars have shown that the stronger the public believe the consensus to be, the more they support the action on global warming that human society so desperately needs. Moreover, anyone who knows that scientists once thought that the continents are fixed in place, or that the craters of the Moon are volcanic, or that the Earth cannot be more than 100 million years old, understands that a small minority has sometimes turned out to be right. But it is hard to think of a case in the modern era in which scientists have been virtually unanimous and wrong. Moreover, as I show, the consensus among publishing scientists is demonstrably not 97\%. Instead, five surveys of the peer-reviewed literature from 1991 to 2015 combine to 54,195 articles with an average consensus of 99.94\%.},

  abstract = {Context It is a common experience in temperate zones that individuals feel happier and more energetic on bright and sunny days and many experience a decline in mood and energy during the dark winter season. Brain serotonin is involved in the regulation of physiologic functions, such as mating, feeding, energy balance, and sleep. Although these behaviors and serotonin-related conditions show a clear seasonal pattern in humans, the molecular background of seasonal changes in serotonin function is entirely unknown. The serotonin transporter is a key element in regulating intensity and spread of the serotonin signal. Objectives To detect seasonal variations in serotonin transporter binding in the living human brain and to detect correlations between serotonin transporter binding and duration of daily sunshine. Design Regional serotonin transporter binding potential values, an index of serotonin transporter density, were assessed from December 1, 1999, to December 9, 2003, in a consecutive sample of healthy volunteers. Binding potential values were related to meteorologic data. Setting Tertiary care psychiatric hospital. Participants Volunteer sample of 88 drug-naive healthy individuals. Intervention Carbon 11-labeled 3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile positron emission tomography. Main Outcome Measure Regional serotonin transporter binding potential values. Results Serotonin transporter binding potential values were significantly higher in all investigated brain regions in individuals investigated in the fall and winter compared with those investigated in the spring and summer (P = .01 to .001). Moreover, binding potential values showed negative correlations with average duration of daily sunshine in all brain regions (\{rho\} = -0.21 to -0.39; P = .05 to {$<$}.001), such that higher values occurred at times of lesser light. Conclusions Serotonin transporter binding potential values vary throughout the year with the seasons. Since higher serotonin transporter density is associated with lower synaptic serotonin levels, regulation of serotonin transporter density by season is a previously undescribed physiologic mechanism that has the potential to explain seasonal changes in normal and pathologic behaviors.},

Prompted by new theories and reformulations of existing ones, over 200 empirical studies explored ecological correlates of crime. Few efforts have been made, however, to "make sense" of this literature. A "meta-analysis" was undertaken to determine the relative effects of macro-level predictors of crime. Indicators of "concentrated disadvantage" (e.g., racial heterogeneity, poverty, and family disruption) are among the strongest and most stable predictors. Except for incarceration, variables indicating increased use of the criminal justice system (e.g., policing and get-tough policy effects) are among the weakest. Across all studies, social disorganization and resource/economic deprivation theories receive strong empirical support; anomie/strain, social support/social altruism, and routine activity theories receive moderate support; and deterrence/rational choice and subcultural theories receive weak support.},

Relating qualitative variables to other variables through a logistic cdf functional form is logistic regression. Estimators generated for one of these problems are often used in the other. If the populations are normal with identical covariance matrices, discriminant analysis estimators are preferred to logistic regression estimators for the discriminant analysis problem. In most discriminant analysis applications, however, at least one variable is qualitative (ruling out multivariate normality). Under nonnormality, we prefer the logistic regression model with maximum likelihood estimators for solving both problems. In this article we summarize the related arguments, and report on our own supportive empirical studies.},

This study sets out to explore the impact of global warming on suicide mortality, using data from Italy.Methods Monthly data on suicide mortality and temperature were obtained for a 30-year period (from January 1974 to December 2003), and the relation between them was investigated using the Gaussian low-pass filter, linear correlation analysis and rank analysis.Results For males, increasing anomalies in monthly average temperatures associated to a higher monthly suicide mean from May to August and, to a lower extent, in November and December. In January, on the other hand, increasing anomalies in monthly average temperatures appeared to be coupled to a lower number of suicides. For females, the links between temperature and suicides are less consistent than for males, and sometimes have a reverse sign, too.Limitations Data could not be analyzed according to age, since this information was not available across the whole time interval. The use of monthly data, instead of daily data (unavailable), is another major limitation of this study.Conclusions An improvement in the ability of communities to adjust to temperature changes by implementing public health interventions may play an important part in preserving the wellness of the general population, and also in limiting the worst consequences of suicidal behaviour.},

The relationship between some climatic factors and suicide and attempted suicide rates has also been analyzed. A significant effect of seasonal change on suicidal behavior, with a clear peak in spring has been detected (ANOVA: df=3/248, F=5.875, p=0.0007 for suicide; df=3/248, F=6.198, p=0.0004 for attempted suicide), with a greater seasonal effect on males than females. The monthly distribution of suicide deaths and of attempted suicides follows a significant direct relationship with exposure to sun, and an inverse relationship with rainfall levels. So, one of the possible explanations for the effect of seasonal change on suicidal behaviour could be the changing seasonal climate. The complex influence of seasonal climate on human biological rhythms, particularly on 5-HT (serotonin) related functions, together with its effects on sociorelational habits, should be considered for suicide prevention.},

  abstract = {In order to ascertain if and how age, gender and choice of lethal means influence the seasonal distribution of suicide in Italy, data concerning all suicides registered in Italy from 1984 to 1995 have been analyzed, taking these variables into account. In the age group 14-65 years and over a total of 31[punctuation space]771 male suicides (mean yearly rate, 12.6 per 100[punctuation space]000) and 11[punctuation space]984 female suicides (mean yearly rate, 4.4 per 100[punctuation space]000) have been identified in Italy during the study period. Suicides in the younger age ranges, both among males and females, show a less marked asymmetrical seasonal distribution than those in the older age groups. Only suicides committed by violent methods (ICD 953-958) show clear evidence of seasonality, with a peak in spring and a low in late autumn. Suicides committed by non-violent methods (950-952) follow no seasonal trend in either sex. Spectral analysis reveals a circannual rhythm for violent suicides (ICD 953-958) in both genders. For male non-violent suicides (ICD 950-952), a period with a frequency of 0.0833 (12 months) has been identified, but with a polarity opposite to that of male violent suicides. For female non-violent suicides, no period of frequency of 0.0833 could be identified, but, as for female violent suicides, a period with frequency close to 0.2500 (4 months) has been found. Changes in climate, then, correlate with the monthly distribution of violent and non-violent suicides in opposite ways: male violent suicides show a significant positive relationship with indicators of temperature and exposure to the sun, and a significant negative relationship with indicators of humidity and rainfall. Female suicides show less significant relationships with climate indicators. Work aimed at suicide prevention should therefore take into account the complex influence of seasonal climate both on human biological rhythms (particularly on 5-HT related functions and their actions on mood and impulsivity) and on sociorelational habits.},

Various statistical approaches have been proposed to examine this idea. However, little attention has been paid to psychometric issues of scaling. Specifically, interval-level data are required to compare performance differences across performance ranges, but only ordinal-level data are available with current literacy measures. To demonstrate the interpretability problems of contrasting growth slopes, we use data from a longitudinal study of literacy development. We explore the possibility of comparing across ages, matched for performance, and we examine the consequences of nonlinear growth, temporal lag estimates, and individual differences in developmental progression. We conclude that, although conceptually appealing, the widening gap prediction is not empirically testable.},

  year = {2009},
  annotation = {Suicide has drawn much attention from both the scientific community and the public. Examining the impact of socio-environmental factors on suicide is essential in developing suicide prevention strategies and interventions, because it will provide health authorities with important information for their decision-making. However, previous studies did not examine the impact of socio-environmental factors on suicide using a spatial analysis approach.   The purpose of this study was to identify the patterns of suicide and to examine how socio-environmental factors impact on suicide over time and space at the Local Governmental Area (LGA) level in Queensland. The suicide data between 1999 and 2003 were collected from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Socio-environmental variables at the LGA level included climate (rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature), Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) and demographic variables (proportion of Indigenous population, unemployment rate, proportion of population with low income and low education level). Climate data were obtained from Australian Bureau of Meteorology. SEIFA and demographic variables were acquired from ABS. A series of statistical and geographical information system (GIS) approaches were applied in the analysis. This study included two stages. The first stage used average annual data to view the spatial pattern of suicide and to examine the association between socio-environmental factors and suicide over space. The second stage examined the spatiotemporal pattern of suicide and assessed the socio-environmental determinants of suicide, using more detailed seasonal data.  In this research, 2,445 suicide cases were included, with 1,957 males (80.0\%) and 488 females (20.0\%). In the first stage, we examined the spatial pattern and the determinants of suicide using 5-year aggregated data. Spearman correlations were used to assess associations between variables. Then a Poisson regression model was applied in the multivariable analysis, as the occurrence of suicide is a small probability event and this model fitted the data quite well. Suicide mortality varied across LGAs and was associated with a range of socio-environmental factors. The multivariable analysis showed that maximum temperature was significantly and positively associated with male suicide (relative risk [RR] = 1.03, 95\% CI: 1.00 to 1.07). Higher proportion of Indigenous population was accompanied with more suicide in male population (male: RR = 1.02, 95\% CI: 1.01 to 1.03). There was a positive association between unemployment rate and suicide in both genders (male: RR = 1.04, 95\% CI: 1.02 to 1.06; female: RR = 1.07, 95\% CI: 1.00 to 1.16). No significant association was observed for rainfall, minimum temperature, SEIFA, proportion of population with low individual income and low educational attainment.  In the second stage of this study, we undertook a preliminary spatiotemporal analysis of suicide using seasonal data. Firstly, we assessed the interrelations between variables. Secondly, a generalised estimating equations (GEE) model was used to examine the socio-environmental impact on suicide over time and space, as this model is well suited to analyze repeated longitudinal data (e.g., seasonal suicide mortality in a certain LGA) and it fitted the data better than other models (e.g., Poisson model). The suicide pattern varied with season and LGA. The north of Queensland had the highest suicide mortality rate in all the seasons, while there was no suicide case occurred in the southwest. Northwest had consistently higher suicide mortality in spring, autumn and winter. In other areas, suicide mortality varied between seasons. This analysis showed that maximum temperature was positively associated with suicide among male population (RR = 1.24, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 1.47) and total population (RR = 1.15, 95\% CI: 1.00 to 1.32). Higher proportion of Indigenous population was accompanied with more suicide among total population (RR = 1.16, 95\% CI: 1.13 to 1.19) and by gender (male: RR = 1.07, 95\% CI: 1.01 to 1.13; female: RR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.03 to 1.48). Unemployment rate was positively associated with total (RR = 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.24 to 1.59) and female (RR=1.09, 95\% CI: 1.01 to 1.18) suicide. There was also a positive association between proportion of population with low individual income and suicide in total (RR = 1.28, 95\% CI: 1.10 to 1.48) and male (RR = 1.45, 95\% CI: 1.23 to 1.72) population. Rainfall was only positively associated with suicide in total population (RR = 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 1.19). There was no significant association for rainfall, minimum temperature, SEIFA, proportion of population with low educational attainment. The second stage is the extension of the first stage. Different spatial scales of dataset were used between the two stages (i.e., mean yearly data in the first stage, and seasonal data in the second stage), but the results are generally consistent with each other.  Compared with other studies, this research explored the variety of the impact of a wide range of socio-environmental factors on suicide in different geographical units. Maximum temperature, proportion of Indigenous population, unemployment rate and proportion of population with low individual income were among the major determinants of suicide in Queensland. However, the influence from other factors (e.g. socio-culture background, alcohol and drug use) influencing suicide cannot be ignored. An in-depth understanding of these factors is vital in planning and implementing suicide prevention strategies.  Five recommendations for future research are derived from this study: (1) It is vital to acquire detailed personal information on each suicide case and relevant information among the population in assessing the key socio-environmental determinants of suicide; (2) Bayesian model could be applied to compare mortality rates and their socio-environmental determinants across LGAs in future research; (3) In the LGAs with warm weather, high proportion of Indigenous population and/or unemployment rate, concerted efforts need to be made to control and prevent suicide and other mental health problems; (4) The current surveillance, forecasting and early warning system needs to be strengthened, to trace the climate and socioeconomic change over time and space and its impact on population health; (5) It is necessary to evaluate and improve the facilities of mental health care, psychological consultation, suicide prevention and control programs; especially in the areas with low socio-economic status, high unemployment rate, extreme weather events and natural disasters.},

I provide a supplementary R script to demonstrate each analytical step described in the paper, which is readily adaptable for researchers to use for their analyses. While the worked example is the analysis of correlational dataset, the general meta-analytic process described in this paper is applicable for all types of effect sizes. I also emphasise the importance of meta-analysis protocols and pre-registration to improve transparency and help avoid unintended duplication. An improved understanding this tool will not only help scientists to conduct their own meta-analyses but also improve their evaluation of published meta-analyses.},

PARTICIPANTS: Participants were undergraduate students defined as maladaptive perfectionists through a screening questionnaire at an urban university. The data were collected from July 2009 to August 2010. METHODS: Forty-seven maladaptive perfectionists were randomly assigned to a 12-week CBT or a wait-list control group and assessed via questionnaires at pre- and postintervention. Statistical procedures included t tests, Pearson correlations, and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: At the postintervention measure, the CBT group demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety sensitivity and negative automatic thoughts compared to the control group. Within the CBT group, changes in perfectionism scores were significantly correlated with positive changes in depression, anxiety, stress, and automatic thoughts. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment group improved on psychological outcomes, demonstrating the effectiveness of a Web-based CBT for perfectionism in a university setting.},

People can adapt to these problems by staying in place and doing nothing, staying in place and mitigating the problems, or leaving the affected areas. The choice between these options will depend on the extent of problems and mitigation capabilities. People living in lesser developed countries may be more likely to leave affected areas, which may cause conflict in receiving areas. My findings support this theory, and suggest certain policy implications for climate change.},

  abstract = {As climate change is becoming an important global issue, more and more people are beginning to pay attention to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To measure personal or household carbon dioxide emission, there are already plenty of carbon footprint calculators available on the web. Most of these calculators use quantitative models to estimate carbon emission caused by a user's activities. Although these calculators can promote public awareness regarding carbon emission due to an individual's behavior, there are concerns about the consistency and transparency of these existing CO2 calculators. Apart from a small group of smart phone based carbon footprint calculator applications, most of the existing CO2 calculators require users to input data manually. This not only provides a poor user experience but also makes the calculation less accurate. The use of a standard framework for various carbon footprint application developments can increase the accuracy of overall calculations, which in turn may increase energy awareness at the individual human level. We aim for developing a carbon footprint calculation framework that can serve as a platform for various carbon footprint calculator applications. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a platform-agnostic Open Carbon Footprint Framework (OCFF) that will provide the necessary interfaces for software developers to incorporate the latest scientific knowledge regarding climate change into their applications. OCFF will maintain a clouded knowledge base that will give developers access to a dynamic source of computational information that can be brought to bear on real-time sensor data. Based on the OCFF platform, we developed a Ubiquitous Carbon Footprint Calculator application (UCFC) that allows the user to be aware of their personal carbon footprint based on their ubiquitous activity and act accordingly. The major contribution of this paper is the presentation of the quantitative model of the platform along with the entire design and implementation of UCFC application. We also present the results, analysis, and findings of an extensive survey that has been conducted to find users' awareness of increased carbon footprint, feature requirements, and expectations and desires to alleviate CO2 emissions by using a footprint calculator. The design of UCFC application incorporates the analysis and inferences of the survey results. We are also developing a fuel efficient mobile GPS application for iPhone suggesting the greenest/most fuel efficient route to the user. In this paper, we also point out some important features of such an application.},

We apply our method to study the effect of warming trends on heat records. We find that the number of record-breaking events increases approximately in proportion to the ratio of warming trend to short-term standard deviation. Short-term variability thus decreases the number of heat extremes, whereas a climatic warming increases it. For extremes exceeding a predefined threshold, the dependence on the warming trend is highly nonlinear. We further find that the sum of warm plus cold extremes increases with any climate change, whether warming or cooling. We estimate that climatic warming has increased the number of new global-mean temperature records expected in the last decade from 0.1 to 2.8. For July temperature in Moscow, we estimate that the local warming trend has increased the number of records expected in the past decade fivefold, which implies an approximate 80\% probability that the 2010 July heat record would not have occurred without climate warming.},

Between 2010 and 2099, climate change will cause an additional 22,000 murders, 180,000 cases of rape, 1.2 million aggravated assaults, 2.3 million simple assaults, 260,000 robberies, 1.3 million burglaries, 2.2 million cases of larceny, and 580,000 cases of vehicle theft in the United States.},

Method: We investigated the seasonal distribution of the specific suicide methods for both genders during a 16-year period. The seasonal effect was explored by monthly ratio statistics from the large population-based data including all suicides in Finland during years 1980-1995 (n=20[punctuation space]234). Results: Hanging peaked in spring among both genders. In summer, the significant peaks were occurred in suicides by drowning, jumping and gassing among males. The bimodality in female suicides with autumn peaks was explained by poisoning and drowning. Traffic suicides showed substantial winter-troughs for both genders. Conclusions: The results suggested that specific violent and nonviolent methods of suicides grouped into their traditional clusters on the basis of their seasonality, except suicides by gassing and shooting. The seasonal distribution in specific suicide methods should take into account in suicide prevention at clinical work and also it should be considered while determining which methods of suicides are regarded as violent or non-violent methods in research.},

Unlike tests of group differences in coefficient alpha that in general do not evaluate the discrepancies in scale reliability coefficients, the described approach permits one to examine differences in the latter quantities of actual interest when concerned with questions pertaining to reliability of composite scores. The method can be used to test whether a given measuring instrument has identical reliabilities in studied populations, and/or whether distinct instruments, or modes of administration of the same instrument, have equal reliabilities across groups.

  abstract = {Two distinct theoretical views explain the effects of action/inaction and social normality on anticipated regret. Norm theory (Kahneman \& Miller, 1986) emphasises the role of decision mutability, the ease with which one can imagine having made a different choice. Decision justification theory (Connolly \& Zeelenberg, 2002) highlights the role of decision justifiability, the perception that the choice was made on a defensible basis, supported by convincing arguments or using a thoughtful, comprehensive decision process. The present paper tests several contrasting predictions from the two theoretical approaches in a series of four studies. Study 1 replicated earlier findings showing greater anticipated regret when the chosen option was abnormal than when it was normal, and perceived justifiability mediated the effect. Study 2 showed that anticipated regret was higher for careless than for careful decisions. Study 3 replicated this finding for a sample holding a different social norm towards the focal decision. Finally, Study 4 found that, when decision carefulness, normality and action/inaction were all specified, only the former showed a significant effect on anticipated regret, and the effect was again mediated by perceived justifiability. Decision justification theory thus appears to provide a better account of anticipated regret intensity in this context than does norm theory.},

Behavioral sciences have informed policy in many other realms (e.g., health, savings), but they are a largely untapped resource for conservation. We propose a set of guiding questions for applying behavioral insights to conservation policy. These questions help define the conservation problem as a behavior change problem, understand behavioral mechanisms and identify appropriate approaches for behavior change (awareness, incentives, nudges), and evaluate and adapt approaches based on new behavioral insights. We provide a foundation for the questions by synthesizing a wide range of behavior change models and evidence related to littering, water and energy conservation, and land management. We also discuss the methodology and data needed to answer these questions. We illustrate how these questions have been answered in practice to inform efforts to promote conservation for climate risk reduction. Although more comprehensive research programs to answer these questions are needed, some insights are emerging. Integrating two or more behavior change approaches that target multiple, context-dependent factors may be most successful; however, caution must be taken to avoid approaches that could undermine one another (e.g., economic incentives crowding out intrinsic incentives).},

The main findings are the following: (1) optimism predicts creativity both directly and through the mediating role of positive affect and the positivity ratio; (2) the relationship between the positivity ratio and creativity is curvilinear, in such a way that an ``excessive'' ratio is detrimental to creativity. The findings stress the relevance of optimism both for individuals and organizations, and suggest that examining positivity ratios is fruitful in the creativity domain, as it has been in other domains, and that negative affect should not be viewed simply as an obstacle when studying employees' creativity.},

Despite an extensive literature, there have been widely divergent findings regarding the direction of the association between area socio-economic characteristics and area suicide rates, with high-quality studies finding either a direct relation (higher rates of suicide in higher socio-economic areas), an inverse relation (lower rates of suicide in higher socio-economic areas) or no association.Method. We performed a systematic review of the literature dating from 1897 to 2004 and identified 86 publications with 221 separate analyses that met our inclusion criteria. We examined the percent of direct, inverse and null findings stratified by key study characteristics including size of aggregated area, socio-economic measure used, region of study, control variables and study design.Results. Analyses at the community level are significantly more likely to demonstrate lower rates of suicide among higher socio-economic areas than studies using larger areas of aggregation. Measures of area poverty and deprivation are most likely to be inversely associated with suicide rates and median income is least likely to be inversely associated with suicide rates. Analyses using measures of unemployment and education and occupation were equally likely to demonstrate inverse associations. Study results did not vary significantly by gender or by study design.Conclusions. The heterogeneity of associations is mostly accounted for by study design features that have largely been neglected in this literature. Enhanced attention to size of region and measurement strategies provide a clearer picture of how suicide rates vary by region. Resources for suicide prevention should be targeted to high poverty/deprivation and high unemployment areas.},

A step-by-step example for creating and implementing a visual analogue scale with visual feedback is given. VAS Generator and the scales it generates work independently of platforms and use the underlying languages HTML and JavaScript. Results from a validation study with 355 participants are reported and show that the scales generated with VAS Generator approximate an interval-scale level. In light of previous research on visual analogue versus categorical (e.g., radio button) scales in Internet-based research, we conclude that categorical scales only reach ordinal-scale level, and thus visual analogue scales are to be preferred whenever possible.},

  abstract = {This article addresses the nature and challenge of adaptation in the context of global climate change. The complexity of ``climate change'' as threat, environmental stressor, risk domain, and impacting process with dramatic environmental and human consequences requires a synthesis of perspectives and models from diverse areas of psychology to adequately communicate and explain how a more psychological framing of the human dimensions of global environmental change can greatly inform and enhance effective and collaborative climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and research. An integrative framework is provided that identifies and considers important mediating and moderating parameters and processes relating to climate change adaptation, with particular emphasis given to environmental stress and stress and coping perspectives. This psychological perspective on climate change adaptation highlights crucial aspects of adaptation that have been neglected in the arena of climate change science. Of particular importance are intra-individual and social ``psychological adaptation'' processes that powerfully mediate public risk perceptions and understandings, effective coping responses and resilience, overt behavioral adjustment and change, and psychological and social impacts. This psychological window on climate change adaptation is arguably indispensable to genuinely multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research and policy initiatives addressing the impacts of climate change.

The exercise reflects a convergent environmental, social, and health psychology perspective, informed by those interdisciplinary bodies of work relating to the social construction and representation of environmental threat; psychosocial environmental impact assessment and monitoring; public and mental health; risk communication and perception; and disaster preparedness and response. Attention is also paid to public understandings of the phenomenon and threat of global climate change, and popular culture discourse and reflections about the psychological and mental health responses to and impacts of `climate change'. The chapter indirectly addresses the unfolding physical environmental impacts of climate change and corresponding psychological, social, and societal consequences, but the principal focus is on public exposure and response to the phenomenon of climate change through multimedia representations of this phenomenon and limited direct experience. The larger context of this chapter and the present coverage is the post\textendash Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] focus on climate change adaptation and mitigation, and the continuing neglect of the psychological, social, and cultural in research and policy considerations and initiatives addressing human and environmental quality, sustainability, and health. The chapter concludes with a brief consideration of what psychology has contributed and can contribute in addressing psychological adaptation to the threat of climate change.},

The major change in the recent CCD is seen as a shift from a framework of understanding the Earth System to a framework of decision making under uncertainties. The traditional (and in part ideological) opposition of mitigation and adaptation policies will have give way to an optimal mix of both. The chapter gives empirical evidence for that analysis from mass media coverage, public opinion, policy making, and the business sector. This shift occurs currently more markedly in Germany than in the U.S., will probably catch up across the Atlantic soon. The final section sketches the outlines of a low-carbon society and discusses some major challenges to environmental sociology such as more systemic views, active engagement in IPCC's working group III, risk analysis of climate solutions, critical assessments of socio-technical experiments.},

People can adapt to these problems by staying in place and doing nothing, staying in place and mitigating the problems, or leaving the affected areas. The choice between these options will depend on the extent of problems and mitigation capabilities. People living in lesser developed countries may be more likely to leave affected areas, which may cause conflict in receiving areas. My findings support this theory, and suggest certain policy implications for climate change.},

This study compares those survey results with 2009 data from a sample of similarly well-educated laypeople responding to the same survey instrument. Not surprisingly, following a decade of explosive attention to climate change in politics and in the mainstream media, survey respondents in 2009 showed higher awareness and comprehension of some climate change causes. Most notably, unlike those in 1992, 2009 respondents rarely mentioned ozone depletion as a cause of global warming. They were also far more likely to correctly volunteer energy use as a major cause of climate change; many in 2009 also cited natural processes and historical climatic cycles as key causes. When asked how to address the problem of climate change, while respondents in 1992 were unable to differentiate between general "good environmental practices" and actions specific to addressing climate change, respondents in 2009 have begun to appreciate the differences. Despite this, many individuals in 2009 still had incorrect beliefs about climate change, and still did not appear to fully appreciate key facts such as that global warming is primarily due to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the single most important source of this carbon dioxide is the combustion of fossil fuels.

Most SUD research aggregates across these symptoms to study the behavior of SUD as a static construct. We use an alternative approach that conceptualizes symptoms as directly interacting variables in psychopathological networks. We apply network models to symptom-level data to investigate the unique roles of individual symptoms and their interactions in SUD. Methods We analyzed 11 DSM III-R/IV abuse and dependence criteria in a sample of 2405 adult twins who reported use of at least one illicit substance six or more times from the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders (VATSPSUD). We estimated a symptom network for each substance class as well as a global network collapsed across all substance classes. We examined similarities and differences across the 6 networks in terms of symptom-to-symptom connections and symptom centrality. Results The global network model revealed several interesting symptom connections, such as a strong predictive relation between tolerance and more-than-planned substance use. The most central symptom was using a drug more than planned. In addition, several interesting differences across substances emerged, both in the strength of symptom connections as well as the centrality of symptoms to each network. Conclusions When analyzed as networks, abuse and dependence symptoms do not function equivalently across illicit substance classes. These findings suggest the value of analyzing individual symptoms and their associations to gain new insight into the mechanisms of SUD.},

Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6\textendash 7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

To better understand the types of ads that have been used in campaigns in the United States, a content analysis was conducted of ads available at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Media Campaign Resource Center (MCRC; Waves 1 through 7). A total of 487 ads were coded. Ads were coded for target audience, primary theme present in the ad, and sensation value\textemdash production techniques that have been demonstrated to attract attention and increase arousal. Primary themes extended earlier studies by focusing on the perceived functions of smoking (weight lose, stress management, controlling negative affect) as well as the traditional themes of industry attack, the health consequences of smoking, secondhand smoke, quitting, and the social image of smokers. A majority of ads were rated as having moderate sensation value, and ads targeted at teens and children were, on the average, higher in sensation value than those targeting general audiences. Changes across time suggest that campaigns are focusing more on adolescent smoking and relying more on attacking the tobacco industry. Research indicates that the functions of stress relief, mood regulation, and weight loss are strong reasons for initiating and continuing to smoke cigarettes; however, none of the 487 ads addressed these functional themes. Implications for developing campaigns that more closely relate to the functions of smoking are discussed.},

These choices differ fundamentally from hypothesis testing, in the style of Neyman and Pearson, which does not consider a noncommittal response; tests are developed as choices between two complementary hypotheses, typically labeled `null' and `alternative.' The same choices are presented in typical Bayesian tests, where Bayes Factors are used to judge the relative support for a null or alternative model. In this article, we use decision theory to show that Bayesian tests can also describe Fisher-style `screening' procedures, and that such approaches lead directly to Bayesian analogs of the Wald test and two-sided p-value, and to Bayesian tests with frequentist properties that can be determined easily and accurately. In contrast to hypothesis testing, these `screening' decisions do not exhibit the Lindley/Jeffreys paradox, that divides frequentists and Bayesians.},

  abstract = {An increasingly popular form of data collection in health psychology research is Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA); that is, using diaries or smartphones to collect intensive longitudinal data. This method is increasingly applied to the study of relationships between state-based aspects of individuals' functioning and health outcomes (e.g., binge eating, alcohol use). Analysis of such data is challenging and regression tree modelling (RTM) may be a useful alternative to multilevel modelling for investigating the association between a set of explanatory variables and a continuous outcome. Furthermore, RTM outputs `decision trees' that could be used by health practitioners to guide assessment and tailor intervention. In contrast to regression, RTM is able to easily accommodate many complex, higher-order interactions between predictor variables (without the need to create explicit interaction terms). These benefits make the technique useful for those interested in monitoring and intervening upon health and psychological outcomes (e.g., mood, eating behaviour, risky alcohol use, and treatment adherence). Using real data, this paper demonstrates both the benefits and limitations of RTM and how to extend these models to accommodate analysis of nested data; that is, data that arise from EMA where repeated observations are nested within individuals.},

  abstract = {It is well known that when uncorrelated measurement error affects both variables in linear regression, there is attenuation of the correlation coefficient and regression slope. The effect of correlated measurement error, however, has received little attention. In medical method comparison studies, such error correlation results from the presence of other, unknown explanatory variables that affect the results of the new test method and the reference test method to which it is being compared. The contribution of correlated measurement error to the observed correlation coefficient can be accounted for by the expression {$\rho$}t1t2 = {$\rho$}1{$\rho$}2 + {$\rho$}E1E2 (1\textendash{$\rho$} 12)1/2(1\textendash{$\rho$} 22)1/2 where {$\rho$}t1t2 is the observed correlation between tests 1 and 2, {$\rho$}1 and {$\rho$}2 are the correlation with true values for tests 1 and 2, respectively, and {$\rho$}E1E2 is the correlation between the test errors. The first term describes the attenuation due to uncorrelated error, the second term describes the effect of correlated error. A positive correlation between the measurement errors reduces the attenuation of observed correlation and slope, but, when the reference method is excellent, the effect is very small. For poorer reference tests whose correlations with true values are less than 0{$\cdot$}9, however, error correlation may result in a slope and correlation coefficient that differ importantly from the values obtained with either uncorrelated error or with no reference test error. Negatively correlated measurement errors magnify the attenuation of slope and correlation. One might suspect the presence of correlated error when the observed regression slope is close to or exceeds 1 and the reference test is known to have suboptimal reliability. This paper provides several clinical examples of potentially correlated diagnostic methods.},

A marked and significant seasonality with a spring and summer peak was found between 1981 and 1989, when the prescription of antidepressants was relatively low and stable. However, this seasonality disappeared in the period between 1990 and 1996, when prescription of antidepressants increased dramatically, indicating that more and more depressed patients were pharmacologically treated. As the seasonality of suicide in the population is the reflection of the seasonal nature of depressive suicides, the result suggests that a decreasing tendency of seasonality in suicide may indicate the lowering rate of depressive suicides in the given population.},

During the last few years especially, the main initial technique, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), has been complemented by other related methods and techniques. The purpose of this article is to critically assess some main recent developments in this field. QCA and connected methods can be considered at two levels: as a research strategy and as a set of concrete techniques. The author first argues that such a strategy displays some decisive advantages in social science research, especially in small-and intermediate-N research designs. Second, QCA as well as three other related techniques, namely multi-value QCA (MVQCA), fuzzy sets and MSDO/MDSO, are presented in brief, and some current debates with regard to these techniques are also summarized. In the third section, the article surveys recent contributions and ongoing efforts that have provided some advances in the application of these techniques, around five key issues: case selection and model specification; measurement, dichotomization and linkage with theory; contradictions and non-observed cases; the time and process dimension; and the confrontation or combination with other methods. Finally, the article discuss the potential for further development of these methods in social science research broadly defined.},

Although the viewpoints span a range of perspectives, the overriding theme that emerges states that significance testing may still be useful if supplemented with some or all of the following -- Bayesian logic, caution, confidence intervals, effect sizes and power, other goodness of approximation measures, replication and meta-analysis, sound reasoning, and theory appraisal and corroboration. The book is organized into five general areas. The first presents an overview of significance testing issues that sythesizes the highlights of the remainder of the book. The next discusses the debate in which significance testing should be rejected or retained. The third outlines various methods that may supplement current significance testing procedures. The fourth discusses Bayesian approaches and methods and the use of confidence intervals versus significance tests. The last presents the philosophy of science perspectives. Rather than providing definitive prescriptions, the chapters are largely suggestive of general issues, concerns, and application guidelines. The editors allow readers to choose the best way to conduct hypothesis testing in their respective fields.

The first IPCC assessments provided uncertainty information in largely subjective form via linguistic categorizations depicting different levels of confidence. Recent assessments have codified linguistic terms to avoid ambiguity and introduced probabilistic ranges to express likelihoods of events occurring. The adoption of formal schemes to express likelihood and confidence provides more powerful means for analysts to express uncertainty. However, the combination of these two metrics to assess information may engender confusion when low confidence levels are matched with very high/low likelihoods that have implicit high confidence. Part of the difficulty is that the degree to which different quantities in the assessments are known varies tremendously. One solution is to provide likelihood information in a scheme with a range of different precision levels that can be matched to the level of understanding. A version of this scheme is also part of the IPCC uncertainty guidance and is described here.},

We suggest that the historical use of such procedures was reasonable and that current users might spend time profitably reading some of Fisher's applied work. However, modifications to NHST, and to the interpretations of its outcomes, might better suit the needs of modern science. Our primary conclusion is that NHST most often is useful as an adjunct to other results (e.g., effect sizes) rather than as a stand-alone result. We cite some examples, however, where NHST can be profitably used alone. Last, we find considerable experimental support for a less dogmatic attitude toward the interpretation of the probability yielded from such procedures.},

Seasonality of suicides, with a clear peak in spring as against the other seasons, accounted for a statistically significant proportion of total variance: around 40\% among males and 39\% among females. Seasonality did not change across time in a relevant way; however, an anticipation of the peak was observed in both males and females over time, with amplitude increasing or decreasing as a function of yearly suicide rates.Limitations Data could not be analysed according to age or to the method of suicide, since this information was not available across the whole time interval.Conclusion The seasonal effect on mortality by suicide is positively related to suicide rates, so much that changes in suicide rates over time correspond to changes in suicide seasonality.},

Two recent European studies, however, have found that the amplitude of this rhythm has decreased over time. The purpose of this study was to examine whether such effects are found in Australia. Australian Bureau of Statistics data on all suicides in Australia 1970-1999 were analysed by spectral analysis. We found that suicide, violent suicide and suicide by males are seasonal and that the seasonal amplitude has increased over time. Males who use violent methods determine the seasonal effect. These results support previous findings that suicide and particularly violent suicide have a characteristic seasonal rhythm. However, the progressive increase in the amplitude of this rhythm over time in Australia is in direct contrast to other European findings. We suggest that this may be related to differences in patterns of anti-depressant use and also the effect of migration on the number of seasonally vulnerable individuals in Australia.},

In contrast, the 20th century ended with contentious argument over the utility of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The NHST controversy may have been at least partially irrelevant, because in certain ways the modeling revolution obviated the NHST argument. I begin with a history of NHST and modeling and their relation to one another. Next, I define and illustrate principles involved in developing and evaluating mathematical models. Following, I discuss the difference between using statistical procedures within a rule-based framework and building mathematical models from a scientific epistemology. Only the former is treated carefully in most psychology graduate training. The pedagogical implications of this imbalance and the revised pedagogy required to account for the modeling revolution are described. To conclude, I discuss how attention to modeling implies shifting statistical practice in certain progressive ways. The epistemological basis of statistics has moved away from being a set of procedures, applied mechanistically, and moved toward building and evaluating statistical and scientific models.},

Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

The following variables were used to characterize the annual rhythm of human conception (birth minus 9 months): amplitude, phase of maximum and minimum, phase and length of the time span when rates are above the annual mean (\{alpha\}), and the steepest upward slope (\{delta\}max) of the curve fitted to the rates. The waveform of the annual rhythm is characteristic for geographical regions (e.g., unimodal or bimodal) and persists as such for many years. In most countries, the onset of \{alpha\} coincides with \{delta\} max and lies close to the spring equinox. This phase of the rhythm is the most stable over time. In many populations, the rhythm has changed in recent years, specifically in amplitude and phase. The phase of the rhythm depends on latitude, with a 6-month difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The latitudinal distribution of amplitudes is less systematic. In spite of the many social influences on timing of conceptions, we conclude that the seasonal component in human reproduction is based on biological factors.},

Hindsight bias embodies any combination of three aspects: memory distortion, beliefs about events' objective likelihoods, or subjective beliefs about one's own prediction abilities. Hindsight bias stems from (a) cognitive inputs (people selectively recall information consistent with what they now know to be true and engage in sensemaking to impose meaning on their own knowledge), (b) metacognitive inputs (the ease with which a past outcome is understood may be misattributed to its assumed prior likelihood), and (c) motivational inputs (people have a need to see the world as orderly and predictable and to avoid being blamed for problems). Consequences of hindsight bias include myopic attention to a single causal understanding of the past (to the neglect of other reasonable explanations) as well as general overconfidence in the certainty of one's judgments. New technologies for visualizing and understanding data sets may have the unintended consequence of heightening hindsight bias, but an intervention that encourages people to consider alternative causal explanations for a given outcome can reduce hindsight bias.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables\textemdash colliders and mediators\textemdash should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

Study 1 waived parental consent, whereas Study 2 required parental consent. The combined dataset included demographic characteristics and Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) study screening test responses. The CRAFFT is an orally administered screen that yields a score from 0-6 and that has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of risk for substance-related problems.Results The participation refusal rate in Study 1, where consent was waived, was 19.7\% (132 of 670 eligible individuals) and in Study 2 (243 of 411 eligible individuals), where consent was required, it was 59.1\% (p {$<$} .0001). Participants did not differ significantly with respect to gender and age but did differ by self-identified race/ethnicity between the two studies. Because the CRAFFT score distributions were highly skewed, we used the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for differences in mean rank. The mean rank in Study 1 was significantly higher than in Study 2 (mean rank 362 vs. 325, p = .02). After controlling for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, the adjusted proportional odds ratio for a one-point increase in CRAFFT score was 1.47 (CI 1.03, 2.10) for Study 1 compared with Study 2.Conclusions The research requirement of parental consent may result in substantial self-selection bias towards a lower risk sample.},

@article{roseMeasurementPredictionConspiracy2017,
  title = {The Measurement and Prediction of Conspiracy Beliefs},
  author = {Rose, Chelsea},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {A conspiracy theory or belief has typically been defined as an allegation of malevolent secrecy and plotting by a group of powerful actors, working in unison to fulfil sinister hidden goals at the expense of the general populace. Such beliefs tend to contradict common (and typically more benign) explanations for events and have the potential to reinforce or be used to `justify' undesirable behaviours (e.g., discrimination, non-adherence to crucial healthcare practices, and environmental damage). However, the social psychological literature, specifically, concerning conspiracy beliefs is in its relative infancy. The overarching aim of this thesis is to provide greater coherency to future literature via a comprehensive examination of the measurement and prediction of conspiracy beliefs.    A review of the existing research illustrates that, to date, the literature has tended to take a `fractionated' approach to the study of conspiracy beliefs. That is, studies have tended to focus on scenario-specific conspiracies, and isolated predictors of conspiracy belief. Demonstrating that belief in real-world conspiracies and a generalised tendency to believe in conspiracies are equivalent has theoretical implications of understanding exactly what leads to these beliefs. To address this issue Study 1 examined the development, validation, and comparison of a Specific Conspiracy Belief Scale and a Generalised Conspiracy Belief Scale. A comparison of the relationships between various psychological predictor variables and both of these conspiracy belief scales was conducted in Study 2. These studies revealed that the Generalised Conspiracy Belief Scale was equivalent in performance in terms of its relationship to various predictor variables, and reliability and validity, to previously used specific conspiracy belief measures. The advantage of using the single generalised measure is its ability to be used consistently and comparatively across a range of different conspiracy scenarios.    The review of the literature also revealed that although a number of predictor variables have been identified as being associated with conspiracy beliefs, studies have tended to only look at a relatively small subset of variables within a given study. Indeed, a critical analysis shows that the variables themselves may fall in to various (not necessarily independent) groupings or clusters: socio-political, personality, psychopathological, cognitive, and psychological control factors. Thus, the second goal of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the relative contribution of the variety of variables that have been suggested as predicting conspiracy beliefs. A comprehensive analysis of the role played by a large number of potential predictor variables on their own and as part of domain groupings was performed within the context of a single population study. This issue formed a second aim of Study 2. The results showed that these variables can be reduced down to several common elements, which reveals there is no (as yet identified) single powerfully predictive psychological cause of conspiracy thinking. Rather, it is likely that psychopathological, socio-political, personality, and cognitive elements combine to explain individual differences in conspiracy belief.    Finally, the validity of the Generalised Conspiracy Belief Scale and the relationships between a subset of key predictor variables (identified in Study 2) and conspiracy beliefs in the context of a wider population sample was a focus of Study 3. By using a large New Zealand-wide sample, Study 3 also broadened the scope of the thesis to examine the potential contribution of key demographic variables and psychological predictor variables in the prediction of conspiracy beliefs. Combining the demographic and psychological variables together in a hierarchical multiple regression revealed that nearly a quarter of variance in conspiracy belief was explained by these factors. However, when removing the shared variance of these predictors a number of demographic and psychological variables became non-significant or weakly predictive at best \textendash{} a finding which again suggests that there are common elements that predict conspiracy belief. The remaining unique predictors of conspiracy thinking suggests that one of these common elements represent a hostile, suspicious, cynical, and threat-based worldview. Finally, although demographic variables do impact conspiracy beliefs, their unique effect is very small, and their effect works indirectly by impacting psychological predictors of conspiracy thinking.    In conclusion, the current thesis has demonstrated that a single Conspiracy Belief Scale can serve as a useful and valid tool for future studies investigating conspiracy beliefs and that although individual psychological and demographic variables only weakly predict conspiracy beliefs on their own, they do cluster around potential themes which can aid in the development in a more comprehensive theoretical perspective on conspiracy.},

Most of these changes are in the direction expected with warming temperature. Here we show that these changes in natural systems since at least 1970 are occurring in regions of observed temperature increases, and that these temperature increases at continental scales cannot be explained by natural climate variations alone. Given the conclusions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely to be due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, and furthermore that it is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent except Antarctica, we conclude that anthropogenic climate change is having a significant impact on physical and biological systems globally and in some continents.},

To assess the cognitive and affective precursors of climate activism, we hypothesize and test a two-stage information-processing model based on social cognitive theory. In stage 1, expectations about climate change outcomes and perceived collective efficacy to mitigate the threat are hypothesized to influence affective issue involvement and support for societal mitigation action. In stage 2, beliefs about the effectiveness of political activism, perceived barriers to activist behaviors and opinion leadership are hypothesized to influence intended and actual activism. To test these hypotheses, we fit a structural equation model using nationally representative data. The model explains 52 percent of the variance in a latent variable representing three forms of climate change activism: contacting elected representatives; supporting organizations working on the issue; and attending climate change rallies or meetings. The results suggest that efforts to increase citizen activism should promote specific beliefs about climate change, build perceptions that political activism can be effective, and encourage interpersonal communication on the issue.},

Two studies were conducted to examine aspects of the construct validity of a pen-and-paper instrument designed to measure informational coping style, the Miller Behavioral Style Scale (MBSS). In Study I, the MBSS was administered to 271 university students to examine item response frequencies, item correlations and internal consistency of the subscales. In Study II the coping responses to a series of different hypothetically threatening situations were examined in a sample of 60 students drawn from the sample used in Study I. The results of Study I indicate a need for revision of the items in the MBSS. The results of Study II provide modest evidence of construct validity and underrepresentation of the MBSS in terms of coping strategies. Furthermore, there was evidence to suggest that the structural approach used in the MBSS fails to capture the precise context in which a coping strategy would be applied and the extent to which a strategy would be used.},

An example is given of the use of power analysis to help interpret null results by setting probable upper bounds on the magnitudes of effects.

Unfortunately, reducing the type I error for null associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null. The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the "universal null hypothesis" that "chance" serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings.},

  abstract = {Publication bias is the tendency to decide to publish a study based on the results of the study, rather than on the basis of its theoretical or methodological quality. It can arise from selective publication of favorable results, or of statistically significant results. This threatens the validity of conclusions drawn from reviews of published scientific research. Meta-analysis is now used in numerous scientific disciplines, summarizing quantitative evidence from multiple studies. If the literature being synthesised has been affected by publication bias, this in turn biases the meta-analytic results, potentially producing overstated conclusions. Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis examines the different types of publication bias, and presents the methods for estimating and reducing publication bias, or eliminating it altogether. Written by leading experts, adopting a practical and multidisciplinary approach. Provides comprehensive coverage of the topic including:  Different types of publication bias, Mechanisms that may induce them, Empirical evidence for their existence, Statistical methods to address them, Ways in which they can be avoided.   Features worked examples and common data sets throughout. Explains and compares all available software used for analysing and reducing publication bias. Accompanied by a website featuring software, data sets and further material.  Publication Bias in Meta-Analysis adopts an inter-disciplinary approach and will make an excellent reference volume for any researchers and graduate students who conduct systematic reviews or meta-analyses. University and medical libraries, as well as pharmaceutical companies and government regulatory agencies, will also find this invaluable.},

Confirming results obtained in laboratory studies, more family disturbances were recorded when ozone levels were high than when they were low. Two-stage regression analyses indicated that disturbances and assaults against persons were also positively correlated with daily temperatures and negatively correlated with wind speed and levels of humidity. Further, distributed lag (Box-Jenkins) analyses indicated that high temperatures and low winds preceded violent episodes, which occurred more often on dry than humid days. In addition to hypothesized relations, it was also found that assaults follow complaints about family disturbances, which suggests that the latter could be used to predict and lessen physical violence. It was concluded that atmospheric conditions and violent episodes are not only correlated but also appear to be linked in a causal fashion. This conclusion, however, was qualified by a discussion of the limitations of archival data and concomitant time-series analysis.},

Further analysis revealed that fewer sex crimes were committed on cold than warm days, and ozone was associated with complaints about obscene phone calls.

Apparent correlations between homicides and climatic variables vanished when a social variable (life expectancy) was partialled out, but an inverse relationship between temperature and suicides retained its significance in analyses that included controls for socioeconomic conditions. It is suggested that research on climate and behavior has been hampered by single-factor explanations, which earlier led investigators to ignore cultural factors and now lead them to deny environmental factors.},

This hypothesis was tested by subjecting calls for service in 1987 and 1988 in Minneapolis, to moderator-variable regression analyses with controls for time of day, day of the week, season, and their interactions as well as linear trend, major holidays, public school closings, the first day of the month, and other weather variables. Temporal variables explained 75\% of the variance in calls for service. As hypothesized, the base rate artifact was responsible for an apparent downturn in violence at high temperatures: Fewer complaints were received during afternoon hours, because they happen to be the warmest time of the day. The results were interpreted in terms of routine activity theory.},

Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p -values, inference by p -values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology.},

The current study investigated the efficacy of guided Internet-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) and predictors of treatment outcome. In total, 156 individuals were included and randomized to an eight-week treatment or wait-list control. Self-report measures of perfectionism, depression, anxiety, self-criticism, self-compassion, and quality of life were distributed during screening and at post-treatment. Intention-to-treat were used for all statistical analyses.

In sum, guided ICBT can be helpful for addressing problems with clinical perfectionism, but research of its long-term benefits is warranted.},

These alternative analysis paths count as additional (multiple) tests and, consequently, they increase the probability of making a Type I error during hypothesis testing. The present article considers this forking paths problem and evaluates four potential solutions that might be used in psychology and other fields: (a) adjusting the prespecified alpha level, (b) preregistration, (c) sensitivity analyses, and (d) abandoning the Neyman-Pearson approach. It is concluded that although preregistration and sensitivity analyses are effective solutions to p-hacking, they are ineffective against result-neutral forking paths, such as those caused by transforming data. Conversely, although adjusting the alpha level cannot address p-hacking, it can be effective for result-neutral forking paths. Finally, abandoning the Neyman-Pearson approach represents a further solution to the forking paths problem.},

The literature in suicidology routinely differentiates among treatment, treatment outcome, and risk assessment (e.g., Rudd, Joiner, \& Rajab, 2000), with no clear theoretical link across the three areas. Additionally, there has been limited work addressing content versus process issues in each area specific to suicide risk assessment. The current theory being offered focuses specifically on the risk assessment process, not treatment outcome. Furthermore, its focus is not on the specific content of risk assessment (i.e., what questions to ask across what content domains). A considerable amount is known about the content of risk assessment (e.g., Rudd et al., 2000). This is a fairly significant departure from the routine in suicidology, but it is one I believe to be important for a number of reasons that are emphasized in this chapter.

We apply an empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, as a function of temperature, to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature ranges for transmission (21.3\textendash 34.0\textdegree C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9\textendash 29.4\textdegree C for Ae. albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger population exposures to transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climate-driven risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the short term, for most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are expected for Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to virus transmission by both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in year-round transmission risk are predicted for Ae. albopictus, we project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions.

Accordingly, research guided by self-determination theory has focused on the social-contextual conditions that facilitate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motivation and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatedness--which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.},

EI was found to be negatively and significantly correlated with Neuroticism, and positively and significantly correlated with Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Correlations of EI with the other measures were in accordance with theoretical expectations; for example, positive with life satisfaction and negative with depression-proneness. Most of these correlations remained significant when the effects of personality were controlled for. These results and regression modelling show that EI accounts for variance in these measures not accounted for by personality. EI was found not to be significantly correlated with cognitive ability. The relationship between EI and alexithymia was investigated using structural equation modelling and factor analysis. The results indicated that the two constructs are distinct, although strongly correlated.},

Aims To assess the effect of 11 September 2001 on the rate of suicide and homicide in England and Wales. Method Analysis of the number of suicides (ICD-9 codes: E950-E959), undetermined injury deaths (E980-E989) and homicides (E960-E969) in England and Wales in the 12 weeks before and after 11 September 2001 and during a similar period in the previous two years. Results The number of suicides reported in the month of September 2001 was significantly lower than other months in the same year and any September of the previous 22 years in England and Wales. A suicide reduction in men, regardless of age, occurred in the week starting Tuesday 11 September 2001. A reduction in female suicide occurred during the four weeks following the attack.There was no evidence of a similar effect on homicide. Conclusions The tragic events of 11 September 2001 appear to have had a brief but significant inverse effect on suicide.The finding of this study supports Durkheim's theory that periods of external threat create group integration within society and lower the suicide rate through the impact on social cohesion.},

This may be due to a variety of methodological problems including small numbers and variability in the definition of suicide. The relationship has not been examined in the elderly.Objectives. To study the effect of weather conditions on suicide rate in an elderly population of 40~000 of North Cheshire aged 65 and above. In this study, coroner's verdicts of suicide and open verdict which were recorded in a specified period were included.Method. Five-year data of deaths resulting from suicide within North Cheshire were analysed in relation to meteorological data, which were measured at the nearest Met office to the study population.Results. Significant positive association was demonstrated between suicide in the elderly and hours of sunshine (p \&lt; 0.01) and relative humidity (p \&lt; 0.05). These effects were independent of sex.Conclusions. Weather may influence suicide in the elderly, probably interacting with biological and social variables. The rate of reported suicide appears to be positively related to fine weather conditions, during early summer, and not to extreme weather conditions as previously reported. Method of death appears to be also associated with weather conditions. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

He is a major contributor to the philosophical discussion of problems associated with causality and the author of two influential books on scientific explanation. This long-awaited volume collects twenty- six of Salmon's essays, including seven that have never before been published and others difficult to find. Part I comprises five introductory essays that presuppose no formal training in philosophy of science and form a background for subsequent essays. Parts II and III contain Salmon's seminal work on scientific explanation and causality. Part IV offers survey articles that feature advanced material but remain accessible to those outside philosophy of science. Essays in Part V address specific issues in particular scientific disciplines, namely, archaeology and anthropology, astrophysics and cosmology, and physics. Clear, compelling, and essential, this volume offers a superb introduction to philosophy of science for nonspecialists and belongs on the bookshelf of all who carry out work in this exciting field. Wesley Salmon is renowned for his seminal contributions to the philosophy of science. He has powerfully and permanently shaped discussion of such issues as lawlike and probabilistic explanation and the interrelation of explanatory notions to causal notions. This unique volume brings together twenty-six of his essays on subjects related to causality and explanation, written over the period 1971-1995. Six of the essays have never been published before and many others have only appeared in obscure venues. The volume includes a section of accessible introductory pieces, as well as more advanced and technical pieces, and will make essential work in the philosophy of science readily available to both scholars and students.},

Methods: NZDep has been created from four 5-yearly censuses using theory developed from international deprivation research, a standard statistical procedure (principal component analysis) and both construct and criterion validation. Results: The latest index was based on nine socio-economic deprivation variables available for just over 4 million people. It was calculated from a basis of 24,000 small areas containing a median of approximately 90 people. The deprivation index has a value from 1 (low) to 10 (high). It is mapped to standard administrative areas and is available free of charge. The index is easy to visualize, and deprivation maps are widely used. The index is used in many applications in research and social epidemiology, and routinely by the country's Ministry of Health, both to explore health variations across the country and to allocate central government funds to local health care providers. Geographers in local government were quick to recognize the index as a good tool for visualizing the diversity and neediness of local communities, and hence as a tool for town and service planning. Conclusion: The national NZDep index of small-area deprivation has been used widely in research on mortality, morbidity and determinants of ill health, and in needs assessment, resource allocation and advocacy.},

  abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via~ quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book:  Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials.   Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls.   Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications.   Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds.  Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging.},

However, there are crucial differences between the scientific underpinning of measurement. While measurement in the physical sciences is supported by empirical evidence that demonstrates the quantitative nature of the property assessed, measurement in the social sciences is, in large part, made possible only by a vague, discretionary definition of measurement that places hardly any restrictions on empirical data. Traditional psychometric analyses fail to address the requirements of measurement as defined more rigorously in the physical sciences. The construct definitions do not allow for testable predications; and content validity becomes a matter of judgment. In order to improve measurement of psychological attributes, it is suggested to, first, readopt the definition of measurement in the physical sciences; second, to devise an elaborate theory of the construct to be measured that includes the hypothesis of a quantitative attribute; and third, to test the data for the structure implied by the hypothesis of quantity as well as predictions derived from the theory of the construct.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the most commonly used statistical methodology in psychology. The probability of achieving a value as extreme or more extreme than the statistic obtained from the data is evaluated, and if it is low enough, the null hypothesis is rejected. However, because common experimental practice often clashes with the assumptions underlying NHST, these calculated probabilities are often incorrect. Most commonly, experimenters use tests that assume that sample sizes are fixed in advance of data collection but then use the data to determine when to stop; in the limit, experimenters can use data monitoring to guarantee that the null hypothesis will be rejected. Bayesian hypothesis testing (BHT) provides a solution to these ills because the stopping rule used is irrelevant to the calculation of a Bayes factor. In addition, there are strong mathematical guarantees on the frequentist properties of BHT that are comforting for researchers concerned that stopping rules could influence the Bayes factors produced. Here, we show that these guaranteed bounds have limited scope and often do not apply in psychological research. Specifically, we quantitatively demonstrate the impact of optional stopping on the resulting Bayes factors in two common situations: (1) when the truth is a combination of the hypotheses, such as in a heterogeneous population, and (2) when a hypothesis is composite\textemdash taking multiple parameter values\textemdash such as the alternative hypothesis in a t-test. We found that, for these situations, while the Bayesian interpretation remains correct regardless of the stopping rule used, the choice of stopping rule can, in some situations, greatly increase the chance of experimenters finding evidence in the direction they desire. We suggest ways to control these frequentist implications of stopping rules on BHT.},

The case of hindsight bias and attempts to remove that bias (debiasing) illustrate this. After an event outcome is known, people display hindsight bias by exaggerating its inevitability, believing they ``knew it all along.'' The magnitude of hindsight bias varies with the ease or difficulty that known or alternative outcomes come to mind; the usually observed hindsight bias may even reverse when outcomes are difficult to bring to mind or increase when alternatives are difficult to bring to mind. Implications of metacognitive experiences can extend to other biases and their debiasing, as well as to how people make sense of the past more generally.},

The two approaches are compared in this paper for the problem of estimating the mean of the finite population. Following some notes on the historical development, criteria for "best estimator" within each approach are discussed. These criteria are applied to a series of examples, which show that several of the classical results can be obtained and reinterpreted without difficulty through the model-based theory. The role of "artificial randomization" is discussed. It is argued that the model-based framework often offers advantages over the design-based one when it comes to presenting a lucid argument in favor of some given sampling procedure.},

  abstract = {Now available in paperback. This book provides a comprehensive account of survey sampling theory and methodology which will be suitable for students and researchers across a variety of disciplines. A central theme is to show how statistical modeling is a vital component of the sampling process and in the choice of estimation technique. Statistical modeling has strongly influenced sampling theory in recent years and has clarified many issues related to the uses of auxiliary information in surveys. This is the first textbook that systematically extends traditional sampling theory with the aid of a modern model assisted outlook. The central ideas of sampling theory are developed from the unifying perspective of unequal probability sampling. The book covers classical topics as well as areas where significant new developments have taken place notably domain estimation, variance estimation, methods for handling nonresponse, models for measurement error, and the analysis of survey data. The authors have taken care to presuppose nothing more on the part of the reader than a first course in statistical inference and regression analysis. Throughout, the emphasis is on statistical ideas rather than advanced mathematics. Each chapter concludes with a range of exercises incorporating the analysis of data from actual finite populations. As a result, all those concerned with survey methodology or engaged in survey sampling will find this an invaluable and up-to-date coverage of the subject.},

Plasma serotonin (5-HT) shows very marked changes throughout the year, with maximum values during the summer and lowest values in the fall, whereas its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) follows a somewhat contrary pattern. The sum of 5-HT plus 5-HIAA in plasma thus does not change significantly during the year and follows the evolution of total plasma tryptophan (TP). The difference of 5-HIAA minus 5-HT in plasma, which is indicative of the efficacy of degradative processes of 5-HT in the periphery, is strongly dependent on the season and suggests a higher degradation of 5-HT during fall-winter. Unlike plasma TP and whole blood 5-HT, significant correlations among plasma 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and the ambient temperature were found. The possible significance and relationship of these findings to the seasonality of major depression is discussed.},

Nonrobust results were obtained primarily under distributions with extreme skew.

An introductory section on cognitivist theories of emotion is followed by a detailed investigation of the concept of `agent-regret' and of the ways in which the `constitutive thought' might be articulated in different situations in which agents acknowledge casual responsibility for bringing about undesirable outcomes. Among problematic cases discussed are those in which agents have caused harm through no fault of their own, or have been constrained to choose the lesser of two evils or to act against their moral values. R. Jay Wallace's `bourgeois predicament' and related cases, in which we recognize that our present advantages have flowed from regrettable antecedents, further show that regret is often not a simple emotion, and it is argued that conflicted regrets are sometimes unavoidable. Finally, the paper looks at Descartes' account of regret as a form of sadness engendered by the recollection of irrecoverable happy experiences, to which the `constitutive thought' does not readily apply. It is suggested that what Descartes is discussing is a different genre of emotion for which `nostalgia' might be a better name.},

These simple expressions should be useful in promoting the use of measurement error models in applications.

In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalising procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and impactful. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychologists have begun to realise that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound `derivation chain' between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various non-confirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and their functional form, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognised and incentivised as a crucial goal in and of itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to non-confirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology's reform movement and help us lay the foundation to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged us to.},

Point estimates, standard deviations and interval estimates for the parameters can be computed from these samples. If the prior distribution over the parameters is uninformative, the posterior is proportional to the likelihood, and asymptotically the inferences based on the Gibbs sample are the same as those based on the maximum likelihood solution, for example, output from LISREL or EQS. In small samples, however, the likelihood surface is not Gaussian and in some cases contains local maxima. Nevertheless, the Gibbs sample comes from the correct posterior distribution over the parameters regardless of the sample size and the shape of the likelihood surface. With an informative prior distribution over the parameters, the posterior can be used to make inferences about the parameters underidentified models, as we illustrate on a simple errors-in-variables model.},

  abstract = {E. Diener, R. J. Larsen, S. Levine, and R. A. Emmons ( 1985) distinguished between intensity and frequency as separable components in repeatedly measured affect. In this article, an improved way of differentiating intensity and frequency of affect is proposed that permits one to measure affect intensity separately for each emotion of interest. The results of 3 studies using this method provide further support for the affect intensity construct and demonstrate the superiority of the new approach. In addition, a new measure based on intensity ratings of hypothetical scenarios proved to be the best measure of affect intensity when it has to be assessed at I moment in time. Finally, results of 2 diary studies, one sampling emotional events and the other sampling random moments, confirmed the hypothesis that affect intensity is best conceptualized as a disposition to react strongly to emotion-eliciting events rather than to experience intense affect in the absence of goal-relevant situations.},

Patterns of missing data are reviewed, and some of the common strategies for dealing with them are described. The authors provide an illustration in which data were simulated and evaluate 3 methods of handling missing data: mean substitution, multiple imputation, and full information maximum likelihood. Results suggest that mean substitution is a poor method for handling missing data, whereas both multiple imputation and full information maximum likelihood are recommended alternatives to this approach. The authors suggest that researchers fully consider and report the amount and pattern of missing data and the strategy for handling those data in counseling psychology research and that editors advise researchers of this expectation.},

However, even if none of this evidence existed in I/O psychology, research findings in differential psychology on the nature and correlates of GCA provide a sufficient basis for the conclusion that GCA is strongly related to job performance. In I/O psychology, the theoretical basis for the empirical evidence linking GCA and job performance is rarely presented, but is critical to understanding and acceptance of these findings. The theory explains the why behind the empirical findings. From the viewpoint of the kind of world we would like to live in-and would like to believe we live in-the research findings on GCA are not what most people would hope for and are not welcome. However, if we want to remain a science-based field, we cannot reject what we know to be true in favor of what we would like to be true.},

A detailed examination of the notion of replication reveals that there are many different meanings to this concept and the relevant procedures, but hardly any systematic literature. This paper analyzes the concept of replication from a theoretical point of view. It demonstrates that the theoretical demands are scarcely met in everyday work within the social sciences. Some demands are just not feasible, whereas others are constricted by restrictions relating to publication. A new classification scheme based on a functional approach that distinguishes between different types of replication is proposed. Next, it will be argued that replication addresses the important connection between existing and new knowledge. To do so it has to be applied explicitly and systematically. The paper ends with a description of procedures how this could be done and a set of recommendations how to handle the concept of replication in the future to exploit its potential to the full.},

Yet despite 90 years of recommendations from measurement theory and methodology, some still do not control for these biases in their research. This paper presents simple and direct demonstrations showing why basic measurement principles require that biases in data created by measurement error be removed and refutes commonly heard objections to the corrections for these biases. One factor contributing to resistance on the part of some researchers is the fact that most psychologists are not aware that measurement error is produced by real psychological processes that can be studied and understood. This paper describes those substantive psychological process and shows how each generates a different type of measurement error. We also show how different types of reliability estimates assess and calibrate different error processes and types of measurement error, leading directly to conclusions about which types of reliability estimates are appropriate for measurement error corrections in different research settings. Failure to control for biases induced by measurement error has retarded the development of cumulative research knowledge. It is our hope that this paper will contribute to removing these hobbles from psychological research.},

Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.

It consists of a collection of experiences, procedures, and research provided by psychologists who specialize in counseling students who seek help for their dilatory tendencies. Although procrastination, or putting off until tomorrow what one should do today, is a phenomenon well-known for thousands of years, it is only recently that systematic research has been conducted with respect to its manifestations, causes, and cures. One probable reason for studying procrastination is that procrastinators continually fail to adhere temporally to schedules they and others have set, which in industrial societies is an important precondition for the efficient use of technology, time, and other resources. This volume is intended as a handbook for counselors, student advisers, and psychologists seeking to prevent or treat procrastination in students. It is organized into three parts. Part I is theoretical, and it begins with two relatively short theoretical background chapters. Part II presents, in a somewhat arbitrary sequence, a number of counseling and intervention models developed for procrastinating students. Finally, Part III is an epilogue consisting of one somewhat critical final chapter on the status and future of intervention models for counseling the procrastinator in academic settings.

METHODS: Data from 650 participants who completed 3 self-report surveys were used to test a confirmatory factor analysis and a structural model as examples of information to be reported. RESULTS: The results displayed are requisite information for any SEM analysis. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for investigators to provide this information so that readers can properly evaluate the results and conclusions based on the analyses.},

In northern hemisphere countries, although non-violent offenses are distributed equally throughout the year, individual violent crimes and collective acts of hostility are characterized by an annual rhythm of incidence, with a peak in the months of July-August and a nadir in December-February. Inverse rhythms were obtained in southern hemisphere countries. These rhythms were found to be correlated in a statistically significant manner with the duration of the daily photoperiod. The existence of similar patterns of annual variations in violent crimes and in the opening dates of wars indicate similarities between individual and collective aggressiveness with respect to the underlying mechanisms and probably also to the means of their prevention.},

  abstract = {The statistical test of the hypothesis of no difference between the average bioavailabilities of two drug formulations, usually supplemented by an assessment of what the power of the statistical test would have been if the true averages had been inequivalent, continues to be used in the statistical analysis of bioavailability/bioequivalence studies. In the present article, this Power Approach (which in practice usually consists of testing the hypothesis of no difference at level 0.05 and requiring an estimated power of 0.80) is compared to another statistical approach, the Two One-Sided Tests Procedure, which leads to the same conclusion as the approach proposed by Westlake (2) based on the usual (shortest) 1\textendash 2{$\alpha$} confidence interval for the true average difference. It is found that for the specific choice of {$\alpha$}=0.05 as the nominal level of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure has uniformly superior properties to the power approach in most cases. The only cases where the power approach has superior properties when the true averages are equivalent correspond to cases where the chance of concluding equivalence with the power approach when the true averages are notequivalent exceeds 0.05. With appropriate choice of the nominal level of significance of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure always has uniformly superior properties to the power approach. The two one-sided tests procedure is compared to the procedure proposed by Hauck and Anderson (1).},

An analysis of web sites of conservative and liberal think tanks suggests that conservatives prefer to use the term "global warming" whereas liberals prefer "climate change." A question wording experiment (N = 2267) illustrates the power of these frames: Republicans were less likely to endorse that the phenomenon is real when it was referred to as "global warming" (44.0\%) rather than "climate change" (60.2\%), whereas Democrats were unaffected by question wording (86.9\% vs. 86.4\%). As a result, the partisan divide on the issue dropped from 42.9 percentage points under a "global warming" frame to 26.2 percentage points under a "climate change" frame. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the acceptability, reliability and validity of the SF-36 health survey in the New Zealand population and provide key population norms. Method: The SF-36 questionnaire was part of the 1996/97 New Zealand health survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 7,862 adults (15 years and over). Results: Overall, in the New Zealand population the questionnaire performed as well as or better than in other national surveys, but there was variability in data completeness across subgroups, and responses were skewed towards the healthy end of the scales. Males scored higher than females on almost all scales; increasing age was associated with decreasing scores (with the exception of the mental health scale); and New Zealand Europeans tended to report better health than the other ethnic groups. Conclusions: Satisfactory psychometric performance was demonstrated for the SF-36 in the New Zealand population, but researchers need to find ways of increasing data completeness in population groups shown here to have lower completion rates. The questionnaire may be better at discriminating patient rather than population subgroups. The SF-36 normative data confirm in kind, if not in degree, population subgroup disparities in health status observed using objective measures. Implications: Overall, the SF-36 questionnaire appears to be a valid and reliable measure of health-related quality of life for the New Zealand population. However, this paper highlights issues for researchers using the SF-36, such as the skewed nature of responses obstained in a population sample.},

In 1960 the median power (i.e., the probability that a significant result will be obtained if there is a true effect) was .46 for a medium size effect, whereas in 1984 it was only .37. The decline of power is a result of alpha-adjusted procedures. Low power seems to go unnoticed: only 2 out of 64 experiments mentioned power, and it was never estimated. Nonsignificance was generally interpreted as confirmation of the null hypothesis (if this was the research hypothesis), although the median power was as low as .25 in these cases. We discuss reasons for the ongoing neglect of power.},

Furthermore, phobias, unlike laboratory fear conditioning, are often acquired in one trial and seem quite resistant to change by "cognitive" means. An analysis of phobias using a more contemporary model of fear conditioning is proposed. In this view, phobias are seen as instances of highly "prepared" learning (Seligman, 1970). Such prepared learning is selective, highly resistant to extinction, probably noncognitive and can be acquired in one trial. A reconstruction of the notion of symbolism is suggested.},

It outlines the current status of U.S. climate change action and explores four overlapping pathways of policy change: (1) the strategic demonstration of the feasibility of climate change action; (2) the creation and expansion of markets; (3) policy diffusion and learning; and (4) the creation and promulgation of norms about the need for more aggressive climate change action. These four pathways seek to fruitfully draw from rationalist and constructivist approaches to policy analysis, without collapsing or confusing the different logics. Building on this analysis, it predicts that future federal U.S. climate policy will include six major components: (1) A national cap on GHG emissions; (2) A national market based cap-and-trade GHG emissions trading scheme; (3) Mandatory renewable energy portfolio standards; (4) Increased national product standards for energy efficiency; (5) Increased vehicle fleet energy efficiency standards; and (6) Increased federal incentives for research and development on energy efficiency issues and renewable energy development. In addition, expanding federal climate policy may bring about significant changes in U.S. foreign policy as U.S. international re-engagement on climate change is likely to occur only after the development of more significant federal policy.},

  abstract = {Introduction: This study describes medical conditions treated in all 47 non-VA hospitals in Cook County, IL during the 1995 heat wave. We characterize the underlying diseases of the susceptible population, with the goal of tailoring prevention efforts. Methods: Primary and secondary discharge diagnoses made during the heat wave and comparison periods were obtained from computerized inpatient hospital discharge data to determine reasons for hospitalization, and comorbid conditions, respectively. Results: During the week of the heat wave, there were 1072 (11\%) more hospital admissions than average for comparison weeks and 838 (35\%) more than expected among patients aged 65 years and older. The majority of this excess (59\%) were treatments for dehydration, heat stroke, and heat exhaustion; with the exception of acute renal failure no other primary discharge diagnoses were significantly elevated. In contrast, analysis of comorbid conditions revealed 23\% (p = 0.019) excess admissions of underlying cardiovascular diseases, 30\% (p = 0.033) of diabetes, 52\% (p = 0.011) of renal diseases, and 20\% (p = 0.027) of nervous system disorders. Patient admissions for emphysema (p = 0.007) and epilepsy (p = 0.009) were also significantly elevated during the heat wave week. Conclusions: The majority of excess hospital admissions were due to dehydration, heat stroke, and heat exhaustion, among people with underlying medical conditions. Short-term public health interventions to reduce heat-related morbidity should be directed toward these individuals to assure access to air conditioning and adequate fluid intake. Long-term prevention efforts should aim to improve the general health condition of people at risk through, among other things, regular physician-approved exercise.},

Population-based, cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 1202 respondents in Portland OR and Houston TX between June and September 2007 regarding awareness, concern, and behavior change related to climate change. The data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Awareness about climate change is virtually universal (98\% in Portland and 92\% in Houston) with the vast majority reporting some level of concern (90\% in Portland and 82\% in Houston). A multivariate analysis revealed significant predictors of behavior change: individuals with heightened concern about climate change (p\&lt;0.001); respondents with higher level of education (p= 0.03); younger compared with older individuals (p\&lt;0.001); and Portlanders more likely to change behavior compared with Houstonians (p\&lt;0.001). Of those who changed behavior, 43\% reported having reduced their energy usage at home, 39\% had reduced gasoline consumption, and 26\% engaged in other behaviors, largely recycling. Qualitative data indicate a number of cognitive, behavioral, and structural obstacles to voluntary mitigation. Although consumers are interested in global climate change\textendash mitigation strategies and willing to act accordingly, considerable impediments remain.

These include the use of polynomial coefficients to model nonlinear change, the modeling of counts (Poisson distributed) or proportions (binomially distributed) as outcomes, the use of 2 different ways of modeling treatment effects in ABAB designs, and applications of these models to alternating treatment and changing criterion designs. Second, issues that arise when multilevel models are used for the analysis of single-case designs are discussed; such issues can form part of an agenda for future research on this topic. These include statistical power and assumptions, applications to more complex single-case designs, the role of exploratory data analyses, extensions to other kinds of outcome variables and sampling distributions, and other statistical programs that can be used to do such analyses.},

A number of studies have suggested that such priming effects can occur, and a prominent illustration is the claim that individuals' accuracy in answering general knowledge questions can be influenced by activating intelligence-related concepts such as professor or soccer hooligan. In 9 experiments with 475 participants we employed the procedures used in these studies, as well as a number of variants of those procedures, in an attempt to obtain this intelligence priming effect. None of the experiments obtained the effect, although financial incentives did boost performance. A Bayesian analysis reveals considerable evidential support for the null hypothesis. The results conform to the pattern typically obtained in word priming experiments in which priming is very narrow in its generalization and unconscious (subliminal) influences, if they occur at all, are extremely short-lived. We encourage others to explore the circumstances in which this phenomenon might be obtained.},

Bipolar depressed, but not UPD, patients exhibited significant seasonal variation (higher spring and summer versus winter mean monthly admission rates), and the admission rates of patients with BPD, but not UPD, correlated significantly with mean maximal monthly environmental temperatureConclusions:~ Increased environmental temperature may be a risk factor for evolvement of major depressive episode in patients with bipolar disorder with psychiatric co-morbidity, at least in cases that necessitate hospitalization and at the examined geographic/climatic region of Israel. Further large-scale studies with bipolar depressed patients with and without co-morbid disorders are needed to substantiate our findings and to determine the role of seasonal and climatic influence on this population, as well as its relationship to the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.},

To date, no study has evaluated the impact of vaccine conspiracy beliefs on human papillomavirus vaccine acceptance. The authors assessed the validity of a Vaccine Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (VCBS) and determined whether this scale was associated with parents' willingness to vaccinate their son with the HPV vaccine. Methods Canadian parents completed a 24-min online survey in 2014. Measures included socio-demographic variables, HPV knowledge, health care provider recommendation, Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), the seven-item VCBS, and parents' willingness to vaccinate their son at two price points. Results A total of 1427 Canadian parents completed the survey in English (61.2\%) or French (38.8\%). A Factor Analysis revealed the VCBS is one-dimensional and has high internal consistency ({$\alpha$}=0.937). The construct validity of the VCBS was supported by a moderate relationship with the CMQ (r=0.44, p{$<$}0.001). Hierarchical regression analyses found the VCBS is negatively related to parents' willingness to vaccinate their son with the HPV vaccine at both price points (`free' or `\$300{${'}$}) after controlling for gender, age, household income, education level, HPV knowledge, and health care provider recommendation. Conclusions The VCBS is a brief, valid scale that will be useful in further elucidating the correlates of vaccine hesitancy. Future research could use the VCBS to evaluate the impact of vaccine conspiracies beliefs on vaccine uptake and how concerns about vaccination may be challenged and reversed.},

In the present analysis, the act of ``justification'' is conceptualized as the ongoing attempt to convince self and/or others that one's beliefs and values, which is to say one's ``version of reality'' or VOR, is correct, defensible, and good. In addressing these issues, this paper is divided into two complementary parts: (a) consideration of justification dynamics and exemplars from a scientific-humanist perspective and (b) an examination of how justification systems and processes have been studied vis-\`a-vis research and theory on beliefs and values as well as an extant model\textemdash Equilintegration (EI) Theory\textemdash and method\textemdash the Beliefs, Events, and Values Inventory (BEVI). \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Competitive and recreational athletes typically perform warm-up and stretching activities to prepare for more strenuous exercise. These preliminary activities are used to enhance physical performance and to prevent sports-related injuries. Warm-up techniques are primarily used to increase body temperature and are classified in 3 major categories: (a) passive warm-up - increases temperature by some external means; (b) general warm-up - increases temperature by nonspecific body movements; and (c) specific warm-up - increases temperature using similar body parts that will be used in the subsequent, more strenuous activity. The best of these appears to be specific warm-up because this method provides a rehearsal of the activity or event. The intensity and duration of warm-up must be individualised according to the athlete's physical capabilities and in consideration of environmental factors which may alter the temperature response. The majority of the benefits of warm-up are related to temperature-dependent physiological processes. An elevation in body temperature produces an increase in the dissociation of oxygen from haemoglobin and myoglobin, a lowering of the activation energy rates of metabolic chemical reactions, an increase in muscle blood flow, a reduction in muscle viscosity, an increase in the sensitivity of nerve receptors, and an increase in the speed of nervous impulses. Warm-up also appears to reduce the incidence and likelihood of sports-related musculoskeletal injuries. Improving flexibility through stretching is another important preparatory activity that has been advocated to improve physical performance. Maintaining good flexibility also aids in the prevention of injuries to the musculoskeletal system. Flexibility is defined as the range of motion possible around a specific joint or a series of articulations and is usually classified as either static or dynamic. Static flexibility refers to the degree to which a joint can be passively moved to the end-points in the range of motion. Dynamic flexibility refers to the degree which a joint can be moved as a result of a muscle contraction and may therefore not be a good indicator of stiffness or looseness of a joint. There are 3 basic categories of stretching techniques: (a) ballistic--which makes use of repetitive bouncing movements; (b) static--which stretches the muscle to the point of slight muscle discomfort and is held for an extended period; and (c) proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation - which uses alternating contractions and stretching of the muscles. Each of these stretching methods is based on the neurophysiological phenomenon involving the stretch reflex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The potential of visual communication to accelerate social learning and motivate implementation of the substantial policy, technological, and life-style changes needed, has begun to be recognised. In particular, realistic landscape visualisations may offer special advantages in rapidly advancing peoples' awareness of climate change and possibly affecting behaviour and policy, by bringing certain possible consequences of climate change home to people in a compelling manner. However, few such applications are yet in use, the theoretical basis for the effectiveness of visualisations in this role has not been clearly established, and there are ethical concerns elicited by adopting a persuasive approach which deliberately engages the emotions with visual imagery. These questions and policy implications are discussed in the context of a theoretical framework on the effects of landscape visualisation on a spectrum of responses to climate change information, drawing in part on evidence from other applications of landscape visualisation. The author concludes that the persuasive use of visualisations, together with other approaches, may be effective, is justified, and could be vital in helping communicate climate change effectively, given ethical standards based on disclosure, drama, and defensibility.},

  abstract = {Psychologists debate whether mental attributes can be quantified or whether they admit only qualitative comparisons of more and less. Their disagreement is not merely terminological, for it bears upon the permissibility of various statistical techniques. This article contributes to the discussion in two stages. First it explains how temperature, which was originally a qualitative concept, came to occupy its position as an unquestionably quantitative concept (\textsection\textsection 1\textendash 4). Specifically, it lays out the circumstances in which thermometers, which register quantitative (or cardinal) differences, became distinguishable from thermoscopes, which register merely qualitative (or ordinal) differences. I argue that this distinction became possible thanks to the work of Joseph Black, ca. 1760. Second, the article contends that the model implicit in temperature's quantitative status offers a better way for thinking about the quantitative status of mental attributes than models from measurement theory (\textsection\textsection 5\textendash 6).},

Some studies have indicated that suicides using violent methods are more likely to show seasonality. Recent research has suggested that seasonal patterns have diminished. This study examined deaths in male farmers, an occupational group which might be expected to be more vulnerable to seasonal influences because of the nature of their work and the relatively high proportion of farmers using violent methods for suicide. Data on suicides between 1982 and 1999 by males in England and Wales aged 15 years and over were provided by the Office for National Statistics. Seasonal patterns of suicide in farmers and nonfarmers were examined by nonparametric tests and harmonic analysis. No significant seasonal variation was found for farmers. For nonfarmers, although a chi-square test showed significant variation in monthly distribution, this was not found when a harmonic analysis was applied. There was no significant difference in the variation of violent suicides throughout the year. This study reinforces recent findings that seasonal variation in suicide appears to be diminishing, even in an occupational group where this might be expected.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ({$\leq$} .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating ``unsuccessful'' replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p {$>$} .05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) ``protecting'' true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular.},

Despite implying merely a change of sign, hypotheses about U-shaped functions are tested almost exclusively via quadratic regressions, an approach that imposes an arbitrary functional-form assumption that in some scenarios can lead to a 100\% rate of false positives (e.g., the incorrect conclusion that y = log(x) is U shaped). Estimating two regression lines, one for low and one for high values of x, allows testing for a sign change without a functional-form assumption. I introduce the Robin Hood algorithm as a way to set the break point between the lines. This algorithm delivers higher power to detect U shapes than all the other break-point-setting alternatives I compared with it. The article includes simulations demonstrating the performance of the two-lines test and reanalyses of published results using this test. An app for running the two-lines test is available at http://webstimate.org/twolines.},

Relying on recently published research, two start-up companies have proposed to use a sophisticated brain-imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to detect deception. The new approach promises significantly greater accuracy than the conventional polygraph--at least under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. But would it work in the real world? Despite some significant concerns about validity and reliability, fMRI lie detection may in fact be appropriate for certain applications. This new ability to peer inside someone's head raises significant questions of ethics. Commentators have already begun to weigh in on many of these questions. A wider dialogue within the medical, neuroscientific, and legal communities would be optimal in promoting the responsible use of this technology and preventing abuses.},

Indeed, research has indicated that perfectionism plays a critical role in early mortality and in the etiology and maintenance of numerous forms of psychopathology. Clearly, this is an area of research that merits our attention. In the introductory chapter to the first edited volume dedicated to the topic of perfectionism, health, and well-being, we present an overview of the issues concerning the conceptualizations of perfectionism, health, and well-being that sets the stage for understanding the complexities and controversies surrounding the role of perfectionism in health-related outcomes that are the focus of this book. After providing a comprehensive summary of the major themes and definitional issues surrounding perfectionism, we present a historical and contemporary introduction to different conceptualizations of health and well-being, highlighting the areas of relevance for understanding potential linkages to perfectionism dimensions. We next present an overview of the structure and organization of the book, summarizing how each chapter provides the latest perspectives and research on perfectionism, health, and well-being. It is our hope as editors that bringing together these contributions in the fields of perfectionism, health, and well-being into one volume will provide a unique and useful resource for readers that will stimulate further research, theory, and debate.},

The present meta-analysis aimed to provide a conceptual update and reanalysis of the procrastination\textendash perfectionism association guided by both a multidimensional view of perfectionism and self-regulation theory. The random-effects meta-analyses revealed a small to medium positive average effect size (r = .23; k = 43, N = 10 000; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) [0.19, 0.27]) for trait procrastination and perfectionistic concerns and a small to medium negative average effect size (r = -.22; k = 38, N = 9544; 95\% CI [-0.26, -0.18]) for procrastination and perfectionistic strivings. The average correlations remained significant after statistically accounting for the joint variance between the two perfectionism dimensions via semi-partial correlations. For perfectionistic concerns, but not perfectionistic strivings, the effects depended on the perfectionism measure used. All effects did not vary by the trait procrastination measure used or the respondent's sex. Our findings confirm that from a multidimensional perspective, trait procrastination is both positively and negatively associated with higher-order perfectionism dimensions and further highlights the value of a self-regulation perspective for understanding the cognitive, affective and behavioural dynamics that characterise these traits.

  abstract = {Background Prevention of violence-related injury has become an important public health issue but national, regional and local data are lacking. The aims of this study were to determine trends, seasonality and rates of violence-related injury according to Accident and Emergency (A\&E) recorded data in England and Wales over a 5 year period, 1995\textendash 2000.Methods A stratified sample of 58 major A\&E departments in England and Wales were recruited for the study. Electronic data on age, gender and date of attendance of all those reporting violence-related injury over a 5 year period, May 1995 to April 2000, were retrieved. Injury rates (number of injured per 100 resident population) were computed and ordinary least-squares regression analysis was used to evaluate linear and non-linear trends in these time series data.Results A total of 353 442 (258 719 males: 73 per cent) violence-related attendances were identified. Overall annual violence-related attendance did not change significantly (p {$>$}0.05) but attendance of females aged 11\textendash 17 years increased steadily and significantly (p {$<$}0.05) over the 5 year period. Health-region, gender- and age-specific increases in violence-related attendance slowed (p {$<$}0.05). Compared with spring there were significantly lower levels of violence in autumn and winter for both males and females (p {$<$}0.05). Violence affecting males aged 18\textendash 30 years was not subject to seasonality. Males, those aged 18\textendash 30 years and those living in the northern and western regions in England and Wales were at highest risk of violence-related injury.Conclusions This national study from the perspective of health services suggests that violence did not increase over the period 1995\textendash 2000. Slowing of age-, gender- and health-region-specific increases in violence-related injury suggests that violence is coming under control. The reasons for significant trends in individual urban centres deserve further study, and could provide important new directions for violence prevention.},

There have been large surveys of victimization in individual cities in Germany, Switzerland, and England. Statistics Canada has completed very large studies of seven major cities, including two surveys of Vancouver, and the Israeli Census Bureau has added victimization questions to a national survey. In addition, small but useful city studies have been conducted in Mexico, Colombia, Israel, and Belgium. The four islands that make up the Dutch Antilles also have been surveyed.

  abstract = {Multiple linear regression, in which several predictor variables are related to a response variable, is a powerful statistical tool for gaining quantitative insight into complex in vivo physiological systems. For these insights to be correct, all predictor variables must be uncorrelated. However, in many physiological experiments the predictor variables cannot be precisely controlled and thus change in parallel (i.e., they are highly correlated). There is a redundancy of information about the response, a situation called multicollinearity, that leads to numerical problems in estimating the parameters in regression equations; the parameters are often of incorrect magnitude or sign or have large standard errors. Although multicollinearity can be avoided with good experimental design, not all interesting physiological questions can be studied without encountering multicollinearity. In these cases various ad hoc procedures have been proposed to mitigate multicollinearity. Although many of these procedures are controversial, they can be helpful in applying multiple linear regression to some physiological problems.},

  abstract = {In its classic formulation, due to Hume (1739, 1748), inductive reasoning is an activity of the mind that takes us from the observed to the unobserved. Tracing the progress of philosophical analyses suggests a blueprint for a descriptive account of inductive reasoning--a mind that can extract relations of similarity and causality and apply them to new categories in relevant ways. In subsequent sections, we argue that this is the same picture that is emerging from empirical work in psychology. Following a long discussion of the general theories on induction, the authors limit the scope of the remainder of the chapter, focusing exclusively on the psychology of categorical induction: How people arrive at a statement of their confidence that a conclusion category has a predicate after being told that one or more premise categories do. Most of the discussion concerns the evaluation of categorical arguments, such as "Boys use GABA as a neurotransmitter." "Therefore, girls use GABA as a neurotransmitter." that can be written schematically as a list of sentences. The general question will be how people go about determining their belief in the conclusion of such an argument after being told that the premises are true. The authors discuss this question both by trying to describe human judgment as a set of phenomena and by trying to explain the existence of these phenomena in terms of more fundamental and more general principles. The phenomena will concern judgments of the strength of categorical arguments or the convincingness of an argument or some other measure of belief in the conclusion once the premises are given (reviewed by Heit, 2000). A number of theoretical approaches have been taken to the problem of categorical induction in psychology. Using broad strokes, the approaches can be classified into two groups: similarity-based induction and induction as scientific methodology. The authors discuss each in turn.},

The present investigation examined the structure of the BTPS using exploratory factor analysis in Study 1 (288 undergraduates) and confirmatory factor analyses in Study 2 (352 community adults) and Study 3 (290 undergraduates). Additionally, in Study 3 the relationships among the BTPS, other measures of perfectionism, and the five-factor model of personality were investigated. Overall, findings provide first evidence for the reliability and validity of the BTPS as a multidimensional measure of perfectionism.},

Participants heard either a proattitudinal or a counterattitudinal message on an involving topic, delivered at a slow (144 words per minute), an intermediate (182 wpm), or a rapid (214 wpm) rate of speech. Consistent with the ELM predictions, rapid speech suppressed the tendency to rebut the counterattitudinal message and enhanced persuasion, whereas the same rapid speech rate inhibited favorable elaboration of the proattitudinal message while undermining its persuasive impact. Thus, a distinctly faster than normal rate of speech on an involving topic can either promote or inhibit persuasion by its impact on message elaboration. The generality of these speech rate effects and the conditions under which rapid speech might serve as a peripheral (i.e., credibility) cue are discussed.},

The rate of global-mean temperature increase in the CMIP5 (ref. 3) archive over 40-year periods increases to 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.05 \textdegree C (1{$\sigma$}) per decade by 2020, an average greater than peak rates of change during the previous one to two millennia.

Methods: The AIS is a self-assessment psychometric instrument designed for quantifying sleep difficulty based on the ICD-10 criteria. It consists of eight items: the first five pertain to sleep induction, awakenings during the night, final awakening, total sleep duration, and sleep quality; while the last three refer to well-being, functioning capacity, and sleepiness during the day. Either the entire eight-item scale (AIS-8) or the brief five-item version (AIS-5), which contains only the first five items, can be utilized. The validation of the AIS was based on its administration to 299 subjects: 105 primary insomniacs, 144 psychiatric patients and 50 non-patient controls. Results: Regarding internal consistency, for both versions of the scale, the Cronbach's {$\alpha$} was around 0.90 and the mean item\textendash total correlation coefficient was about 0.70. Moreover, in the factor analysis, the scale emerged as a sole component. The test\textendash retest reliability correlation coefficient was found almost 0.90 at a 1-week interval. As far as external validity is concerned, the correlations of the AIS-8 and AIS-5 with the Sleep Problems Scale were 0.90 and 0.85, respectively. Conclusion: The high measures of consistency, reliability, and validity of the AIS make it an invaluable tool in sleep research and clinical practice.},

The results revealed that the cognitive model, psychopathological model and psychosocial model did not fit the data well individually. However, an integrative model that included 22 psychopathological constructs, five cognitive constructs, and four psychosocial constructs fit the data very well. Both males and females conceptualized the constructs similarly, and there were no significant latent gender mean differences in any constructs involved in the research model, including radicalism. These findings imply that none of the models can solely explain radicalism, whereas the integrative model can.

A factor analysis of the reasons for procrastination Ss listed in a procrastination assessment scale indicated that the factors Fear of Failure and Aversiveness of the Task accounted for most of the variance. A small but very homogeneous group of Ss endorsed items on the Fear of Failure factor that correlated significantly with self-report measures of depression, irrational cognitions, low self-esteem, delayed study behavior, anxiety, and lack of assertion. A larger and relatively heterogeneous group of Ss reported procrastinating as a result of aversiveness of the task. The Aversiveness of the Task factor correlated significantly with depression, irrational cognitions, low self-esteem, and delayed study behavior.

This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450\textendash 600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the ``dust bowl'' era and inexorable sea level rise.

The study seeks to determine (1) whether a raised incidence of non-right-handedness exists in these samples (2) if so, what constructs best represent this shift in the handedness distribution (i.e., phenotype and CNS substrate) and (3) whether these handedness phenotypes are associated with different levels of cognitive functioning. The results reveal a dramatic shift away from right-handedness in both autistic samples, due to a raised incidence of two phenotypes, manifest left-handedness and ambiguous handedness. The ambiguously handed, who were postulated to represent substantial bilateral CNS pathology due to early brain injury, were found to have much lower intellectual scores in one of the study samples.},

Examine whether community socioeconomic status (SES) and crime-relevant land uses strengthen or weaken the temperature impact. A theoretical framework relying on routine activity theory, crime pattern theory, and resident-based control dynamics organized predictions. Data and methods For Philadelphia census tracts (n = 381), monthly street robbery counts and temperature data for 36 consecutive months were combined with census and land use data, and analyzed with multilevel models. Results Community robbery counts were higher when temperatures were higher, and in lower SES communities. In support of previous work with property crime, but in contrast to previous work with assault, the effects of temperature were stronger in higher SES communities. In support of the integrated model, commercial land use prevalence and subway stations were associated with heightened temperature impacts on robbery. Conclusions Community-level fixed and random effects of temperature on urban robbery counts persist when controlling for land use and community structure; further, the random effects depend in part on both. There are implications for understanding indigenous guardianship or informal resident-based place management dynamics, and for planning seasonal police deployments.},

Our main finding is that environmental factors such as ambient temperature may play a role in the regional distribution of completed suicide in France. Both the stepwise regression analysis and the controlled regression analysis revealed that, among all the variables studied (environmental and sociological), the main factors affecting the regional distribution of suicide were ambient temperature and sunlight duration. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study demonstrating a clear relationship between environmental variables and suicidal behavior. The finding may be consistent with the recent description of forms of affective disorders occuring in relationship to environmental factors.},

A clear seasonal variation (with peaks in May and September) in suicidal behavior was detected. These patterns tended to differ as a function of age (bimodal in young, unimodal in old people). The component analysis clearly pointed out that seasonal patterns of suicides may be considered as the sum of two components, unimodal and bimodal.

Revolution 2.0 is an uprising focused on how we should be doing science now (i.e., in a 2.0 world). The precipitating events of the revolution have already been well-documented: failures to replicate, questionable research practices, fraud, etc. And the fact that none of these events is new to our field has also been well-documented. I suggest four interconnected reasons as to why this time is different: changing technology, changing demographics of researchers, limited resources, and misaligned incentives. I then describe two reasons why the revolution is more likely to catch on this time: technology (as part of the solution) and the fact that these concerns cut across social and life sciences\textemdash that is, we are not alone. Neither side in the revolution has behaved well, and each has characterized the other in extreme terms (although, of course, each has had a few extreme actors). Some suggested reforms are already taking hold (e.g., journals asking for more transparency in methods and analysis decisions; journals publishing replications) but the feared tyrannical requirements have, of course, not taken root (e.g., few journals require open data; there is no ban on exploratory analyses). Still, we have not yet made needed advances in the ways in which we accumulate, connect, and extract conclusions from our aggregated research. However, we are now ready to move forward by adopting incremental changes and by acknowledging the multiplicity of goals within psychological science.},

  abstract = {Recently, some authors have questioned the validity of methods which correct relative risk estimates for measurement error and misclassification when the "gold standard" used to obtain information about the measurement error process is itself imperfect. When such an "alloyed" gold standard is used to validate the usual exposure measurement, the bias in the "regression calibration" (Rosner et al., Stat Med 1989; 8: 1051-69) measurement-error correction factor for relative risks estimated from logistic regression models is derived. This quantity is a function of the correlations of the "alloyed" gold standard (X) and the usual exposure assessment method (Z) with the truth, of the ratio of the variances of X and Z, and of the correlation between the errors in the "alloyed" gold standard and the errors in the usual exposure assessment method. In this paper, it is proven that if the errors between Z and X are uncorrelated, the regression calibration method has no bias even when the gold standard is "alloyed." When a third method of exposure assessment is available and it is reasonable to assume that the errors in this method are uncorrelated with the errors in the other two exposure assessment methods, point and interval estimates of the correlation between the errors in X and Z are derived. These methods are illustrated here with data on the measurement of physical activity, vitamins A and E, and poly- and monounsaturated fat. In addition, when a third exposure assessment method is available, a modification of standard regression calibration is derived which can be used to calculate point and interval estimates of relative risk that are corrected for measurement error in both X and Z. This new method is illustrated here with data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a study investigating the associations between physical activity and colon cancer incidence and between vitamin E intake and coronary heart disease. It is shown that in these examples, correlations of the errors in X and Z tended to be small. Even when moderate, estimates of relative risk corrected for error in both X and Z were not very different from the estimates which assumed that X was a true gold standard.

The respondents were divided into three groups based on their level of exposure and proximity to the event. The findings partially support the stated hypotheses. As expected, the Oklahoma City groups reported higher levels of post-disaster disturbance than the comparison sample, although only PTSD and victimization could be used to differentiate among the three groups.},

Because some monoaminergic mechanisms seem to be similar in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, we tested whether serotonergic or dopaminergic biochemical parameters in peripheral venous blood are related or not to violent suicide behavior.We simultaneously studied plasma serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid (HVA) and platelet 5-HT content in patients within 3 days following a violent suicide attempt and in matched healthy controls. We examined their relationship with depression and impulsivity. Twenty seven drug-free suicide attempters and controls were included. Plasma 5-HIAA and platelet 5-HT concentrations were lower in suicide attempters than in controls. Fifteen patients were classified as impulsive (I), including all patients suffering from personality disorder and alcohol abuse, and 12 as non impulsive (NI), mostly melancholics. MADRS scores were similar in both I and NI suicide attempters.When controlling for age, plasma 5-HIAA was lower in I than in NI suicide attempters or controls; these findings are similar to those we observed recently with CSF 5-HIAA in I and NI violent suicide attempters. Contrarily, platelet 5-HT levels were lower in NI than in I patients or controls. Plasma HVA was not associated with suicide behavior. Plasma 5-HIAA concentration was inversely associated with the degree of impulsivity and platelet 5-HT with the intensity of depression. This study indicates that each peripheral serotonergic index is specifically related to a distinct clinical feature and shows differential alteration according to the impulsivity group. In I and NI drug-free violent suicide attempters an inverse figure between plasma 5-HIAA and platelet 5-HT data was observed indicating a non parallelism between these two peripheral variables. Further prospective studies are needed to investigate whether these peripheral serotonergic parameters may be used as helpful early predictors of violent suicide behavior.},

A low probability of punishment is reflected by few tried cases of academic misconduct. The authors argue that students who are in the minority by not engaging in academic dishonesty show considerable character strength and are examples of everyday heroes. The authors consider heroes persons who are courageous, have empathic concern for others, and have a high degree of honesty. Experiment 1 established courage, empathy, and honesty as predictors of academic honesty. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and found heroism to be predictive of students' future intent to cheat. These experiments have constructed an effective working model of heroism in the context of the academic environment. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

Female labor force participation (FPLF), an index of role conflict, is found to be positively related to both male and female suicide. However, when the sample is restricted to nations at high levels of FPLF, FPLF is related only to male suicide. This failure of FPLF to increase female suicide is interpreted in terns of role expansion theory and the context of greater cultural support for FPLF. The results are independent of indicators from industrialization and anomie theories of suicide.},

In Study 1, data were collected from three physical activity samples. After establishing internal consistencies for all scales, bivariate and interfactor correlations were calculated and the results supported a simplex pattern across samples. The SIMS factorial validity across the three samples was tested via confirmatory factor analysis. Based on modification indices and theoretical justification, the SIMS was reduced to a 14-item model and the multisample invariance of this solution was examined. Results supported partial invariance. In Study 2, a total of 1,008 female PE students responded to the SIMS under two experimental conditions. Internal consistency and the assumed simplex pattern was again supported. Finally, the results of multisample CFA were consistent with the proposed post hoc model respecifications suggested in Study 1, supporting partial invariance.},

DESIGN Retrospective epidemiological survey of deaths due to external causes. Data sources included Coroner's Inquest, GP and hospital data. Logistic regression was carried out to determine the multiple effect of individual factors on defining Coroner's verdict. SETTING Merseyside and Cheshire, United Kingdom. SUBJECTS Males aged 15-39 years who died from unnatural causes during 1995 in Merseyside and Cheshire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Coroner's verdict. RESULTS An active mode of death was by far the strongest predictor of a suicide as opposed to an accident verdict. Other significant differentiating factors included expressed intent, behavioural change, deliberate self-harm and psychiatric contact. CONCLUSION The validity of using method of death as a predictor of intent is questionable. Evidence left by drug users who kill themselves may differ from that left by non-drug users and may need to be sought in less conventional ways. There may be a discrepancy between those factors deemed important by health professionals as indicators of suicide, such as deliberate self-harm, and those given most weight by the Coroner. It may be more pragmatic, in terms of public health policy development, to challenge the concept that self-destructive behaviour can be categorized as being either intentional or unintentional. There is some evidence suggesting that deaths due to suicide and accidents both result from elements of self-destructive behaviour and therefore, the practice of categorizing deaths as either suicides or accidents could be misleading.},

Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

  abstract = {Objective Taking Beswick, Rothblum, and Mann's seminal paper on academic procrastination as a starting point, we provide an updated review of academic procrastination and consolidate this knowledge with a procrastination typology. The goal of our study was to show that while the degree of procrastination is largely contingent on the trait of conscientiousness, the other four major personality traits determine how procrastination manifests. According to implications of need theory, we operationalised these four traits by the reasons students gave and the activities students pursued while procrastinating. Method Participants were 167 students of an undergraduate introductory psychology course. It was designed as a self-directed computerised course enabled considerable amounts of procrastination. Students filled out a Big Five Inventory and wrote a short essay detailing: (a) what reason they saw as causing them to procrastinate, and (b) what activities they pursued while procrastinating. The reasons and activities were coded according to their fit to the personality traits. Results Conscientiousness and its facets were the strongest correlates with procrastination. Moreover, in regression analyses, the other personality traits did not incrementally predict procrastination. However, the reasons ascribed to procrastination and the off-task activities pursued reflected the other personality traits. Conclusion While conscientiousness is the core for all procrastination types, the other personality traits determine its phenomenology. Thus, the prominent understanding of a neurotic procrastinator might be misleading for research and practice. In fact, counsellors need to first address the conscientiousness core of procrastination and then match the subsequent interventions to the specific procrastination type.},

Hence, the relevant conceptual, theoretical, and empirical work is reviewed, drawing upon correlational, experimental, and qualitative findings. A meta-analysis of procrastination's possible causes and effects, based on 691 correlations, reveals that neuroticism, rebelliousness, and sensation seeking show only a weak connection. Strong and consistent predictors of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, self-efficacy, and impulsiveness, as well as conscientiousness and its facets of self-control, distractibility, organization, and achievement motivation. These effects prove consistent with temporal motivation theory, an integrative hybrid of expectancy theory and hyperbolic discounting. Continued research into procrastination should not be delayed, especially because its prevalence appears to be growing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Three types of support (citizenship actions, policy support and acceptance, and personal-sphere behaviors that accord with movement principles) are empirically distinct from each other and from committed activism. Drawing on theoretical work on values and norm-activation processes, we propose a value-belief-norm (VBN) theory of movement support. Individuals who accept a movement's basic values, believe that valued objects are threatened, and believe that their actions can help restore those values experience an obligation (personal norm) for pro-movement action that creates a predisposition to provide support; the particular type of support that results is dependent on the individual's capabilities and constraints. Data from a national survey of 420 respondents suggest that the VBN theory, when compared with other prevalent theories, offers the best available account of support for the environmental movement.},

  abstract = {This best-selling text is written for those who use, rather than develop statistical methods. Dr. Stevens focuses on a conceptual understanding of the material rather than on proving results. Helpful narrative and numerous examples enhance understanding and a chapter on matrix algebra serves as a review. Annotated printouts from SPSS and SAS indicate what the numbers mean and encourage interpretation of the results. In addition to demonstrating how to use these packages, the author stresses the importance of checking the data, assessing the assumptions, and ensuring adequate sample size by providing guidelines so that the results can be generalized. The book is noted for its extensive applied coverage of MANOVA, its emphasis on statistical power, and numerous exercises including answers to half. The new edition features:  New chapters on Hierarchical Linear Modeling (Ch. 15) and Structural Equation Modeling (Ch. 16) New exercises that feature recent journal articles to demonstrate the actual use of multiple regression (Ch. 3), MANOVA (Ch. 5), and repeated measures (Ch. 13)  A new appendix on the analysis of correlated observations (Ch. 6) Expanded discussions on obtaining non-orthogonal contrasts in repeated measures designs with SPSS and how to make the identification of cell ID easier in log linear analysis in 4 or 5 way designs Updated versions of SPSS (15.0) and SAS (8.0) are used throughout the text and introduced in chapter 1 A book website with data sets and more. Ideal for courses on multivariate statistics found in psychology, education, sociology, and business departments, the book also appeals to practicing researchers with little or no training in multivariate methods. Prerequisites include a course on factorial ANOVA and covariance. Working knowledge of matrix algebra is not assumed.},

Results indicated that although belief in the Kampusch conspiracy theory declined between testing periods, the effect size of the difference was small. In addition, belief in the Kampusch conspiracy theory was significantly predicted by general conspiracist ideation at both time points. The need to conduct further longitudinal tests of conspiracist ideation is emphasized in conclusion.},

A number of individuals have argued for an alternative view that implies little or no relationship between scale of measurement and proper analytical techniques. These counterarguments are criticized. Stevens' original thesis is then reexamined in light of recent work on meaningfulness issues in measurement. The importance of measurement issues for an interpretable analysis is confirmed. However, the invariance criterion for selecting analytical techniques has severe problems, even though it is usually the only practicable criterion available.

Results showed that (a) perfectionistic strivings showed positive correlations with time on task and with task performance and (b) that time on task fully mediated the relationship between perfectionistic strivings and task performance.

The technique adopted here, namely integrated assessment (IA) focus groups, in which groups of randomly selected individuals in Switzerland looked at models of possible consequences of climate change and questioned specialists as to their accuracy and meaning, revealed a rich assembly of reactions. Respondents were alarmed about the consequences of high-energy futures, and mollified by images of low-energy futures. Yet they also erected a series of psychological barriers to justify why they should not act either individually or through collective institutions to mitigate climate change. From the viewpoint of changing their lifestyles of material comfort and high-energy dependence, they regarded the consequences of possible behavioural shift arising from the need to meet mitigation measures as more daunting. To overcome the dissonance created in their minds they created a number of socio-psychological denial mechanisms. Such mechanisms heightened the costs of shifting away from comfortable lifestyles, set blame on the inaction of others, including governments, and emphasised doubts regarding the immediacy of personal action when the effects of climate change seemed uncertain and far away. These findings suggest that more attention needs to be given to the social and psychological motivations as to why individuals erect barriers to their personal commitment to climate change mitigation, even when professing anxiety over climate futures. Prolonged and progressive packages of information tailored to cultural models or organised belief patterns, coupled to greater community based policy incentives may help to widen the basis of personal and moral responsibility.},

The question is more than academic, since people affected by the event will be interested in recurring damages if they find that someone is at fault. However, since this extreme event could have occurred by chance in an unperturbed climate, we are currently unable to properly respond to this question. A solution lies in recognising the similarity with the cause-effect issue in the epidemiological field. The approach there is to consider the changes in the risk of the event occurring as attributable, as against the occurrence of the event itself. Inherent in this approach is a recognition that knowledge of the change in risk as well as the amplitude of the forcing itself are uncertain. Consequently, the fraction of the risk attributable to the external forcing is a probabilistic quantity. Here we develop and demonstrate this methodology in the context of the climate change problem.},

  abstract = {This article presents a new model for understanding the role of the self in cognitive dissonance processes. We focus on the controversies among three major theories of how cognitions about the self mediate dissonance processes: Self-consistency (Aronson, 1992), Self-affirmation (Steele, 1988), and the New Look perspective (Cooper \&amp; Fazio, 1984). It is argued that each of these contemporary revisions of dissonance theory assumes that dissonance begins when people commit a behavior and then assess the meaning of the behavior against a standard for judgment. However, each approach makes different predictions for how self-knowledge mediates dissonance because each assumes different self-attributes and standards are used to assess the psychological meaning of a given behavior. The proposed model suggests that the basis of dissonance motivation and the role played by cognitions about the self depend on the type of self-standards made accessible in the context of discrepant behavior. By examining the ways in which people use self-standards to assess the social appropriateness or personal quality of their behavior and use self-attributes to reduce their discomfort, the proposed model can predict the conditions under which each of the contemporary views of the self in dissonance is the most accurate explanation of the process of dissonance arousal and reduction.},

Aim of the study is to examine in the context of a natural disaster the potential effects of resilience on the relation between coping and trauma spectrum symptoms, using structural equation modeling. A sample of 371 students who survived the earthquake in L'Aquila (Italy) were cross-sectionally evaluated using Resilience Scale for Adolescents, Brief Cope and Trauma and Loss Spectrum scale. The model shows a direct path of positive and emotional coping styles on resilience. Emotional coping shows also a direct impact on the outcome; positive and emotional coping results to be positively correlated as well as emotional and disengagement coping styles. Resilience directly affects the PTSD symptoms, partially mediating the impact of the coping styles. The model explains 30\% of the variance in the outcome, i.e. the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, with very good fit indexes. Resilience operates as a protective factor from stress symptom development. It is likely that emotional and disengagement coping skills are rapidly involved after a traumatic exposure but when problem focused coping intervenes, resilience allows it to buffer the stressors or even guides toward a more successful outcome.},

For example, the relationship between O2 consumption and O2 delivery may be of interest, although these may be computed from measurements of cardiac output and blood O2 contents. If a measured variable is used in the calculation of two derived parameters, error in the measurement will couple the calculated parameters and introduce a bias, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. This paper presents a method of correcting for this bias in the linear regression coefficient and the Pearson correlation coefficient when calculations involve the nonlinear and linear combination of the measured variables. The general solution is obtained when the first two terms of a Taylor series expansion of the function can be used to represent the function, as in the case of multiplication. A significance test for the hypothesis that the regression coefficient is equal to zero is also presented. Physiological examples are provided demonstrating this technique, and the correction methods are also applied in simulations to verify the adequacy of the technique and to test for the magnitude of the coupling effect. In two previous studies of O2 consumption and delivery, the effect of coupled error is shown to be small when the range of O2 deliveries studied is large, and measurement errors are of reasonable size.},

This article first outlines the logic of "noninferiority" testing by differentiating between the null hypothesis (that which we are trying to nullify) and the "nill" hypothesis (there is no difference), reversing the role of the null and alternate hypotheses, and defining an interval within which groups are said to be equivalent. We then work through an example and show how to calculate sample sizes for noninferiority studies.},

Recent demonstrations of the psychological benefits of regret have been framed against an assumption that most people find regret to be aversive, both when experienced but also when recalled later. Two studies explored lay evaluations of regret experiences, revealing them to be largely favorable rather than unfavorable. Study 1 demonstrated that regret, but not other negative emotions, was dominated by positive more than negative evaluations. In both Studies 1 and 2, although participants saw a great deal of benefit from their negative emotions, regret stood out as particularly beneficial. Indeed, in Study 2, regret was seen to be the most beneficial of 12 negative emotions on all five functions of: making sense of past experiences, facilitating approach behaviors, facilitating avoidance behaviors, gaining insights into the self, and in preserving social harmony. Moreover, in Study 2, individuals made self-serving ascriptions of regret, reporting greater regret experiences for themselves than for others. In short, people value their regrets substantially more than they do other negative emotions.}

Main outcome measures: Number of reviews with missing studies and effect on conclusions of meta-analyses. Results: The trim and fill fixed effects analysis method estimated that 26 (54\%) of reviews had missing studies and in 10 the number missing was significant. The corresponding figures with a random effects model were 23 (48\%) and eight. In four cases, statistical inferences regarding the effect of the intervention were changed after the overall estimate for publication bias was adjusted for. Conclusions: Publication or related biases were common within the sample of meta-analyses assessed. In most cases these biases did not affect the conclusions. Nevertheless, researchers should check routinely whether conclusions of systematic reviews are robust to possible non-random selection mechanisms.},

  abstract = {This essay describes differences between papers that contain some theory rather than no theory. There is little agreement about what constitutes strong versus weak theory in the social sciences, but there is more consensus that references, data, variables, diagrams, and hypotheses are not theory. Despite this consensus, however, authors routinely use these five elements in lieu of theory. We explain how each of these five elements can be confused with theory and how to avoid such confusion. By making this consensus explicit, we hope to help authors avoid some of the most common and easily averted problems that lead readers to view papers as having inadequate theory. We then discuss how journals might facilitate the publication of stronger theory. We suggest that if the field is serious about producing stronger theory, journals need to reconsider their empirical requirements. We argue that journals ought to be more receptive to papers that test part rather than all of a theory and use illustrative rather than definitive data.},

  abstract = {While pathological self-mutilating behavior has been clinically examined for over 65 years, and much of the literature hypothesizes some function for the behavior, there has been little attempt to integrate or differentiate between different functional ideas. This review uses six functional models extracted from the literature to organize a discussion of the multiple functions of self-mutilation, acknowledging the overdetermined nature of the behavior and attempting to understand how self-mutilation can serve multiple functions simultaneously. Contextual information about the definition, prevalence, phenomenology, patient characteristics, associated diagnoses, and associated symptoms of self-mutilation is first presented. Six functional models are then presented: the environmental model, the antisuicide model, the sexual model, the affect regulation model, the dissociation model, and the boundaries model. Support for these models in the empirical and theoretical literature is presented and treatment implications are explored.},

  abstract = {Some decisions made today have far-reaching consequences as exemplified by those concerning nuclear power and spent nuclear fuel. The investigation presented here uses a decision theoretic framework in which time horizons and the discounting of negative consequences play significant roles. The results indicated wide variations in the lengths of the planning horizons judged to be adequate not only across a number of activities, including nuclear waste management, but also across groups of subjects (e.g., engineering students, retired people, and nuclear fuel experts). The paper reports typical judgments and correlations between different variables for different groups of subjects. The differences across groups reflect potential sources of conflict, depending in part on different values and different perceptions of more or less uncertain facts. Discounting functions for negative consequences in the future were also established. A range in differences in the speed of discounting were found and illustrated. Furthermore, it was found that substantial proportions in all groups regarded negative consequences related to nuclear waste as nondiscountable. When asked about the effect of time until outcome on acceptable probability of a negative outcome, many subjects used the probability concept in an incoherent way, illustrating the great difficulty in communicating small probabilities in a long-term risk context.},

In Study 1, 817 Britons indicated their agreement with conspiracist ideation concerning the July 7, 2005 (7/7), London bombings, and completed a battery of individual difference scales. Results showed that stronger belief in 7/7 conspiracy theories was predicted by stronger belief in other real-world conspiracy theories, greater exposure to conspiracist ideation, higher political cynicism, greater support for democratic principles, more negative attitudes to authority, lower self-esteem, and lower Agreeableness. In Study 2, 281 Austrians indicated their agreement with an entirely fictitious conspiracy theory and completed a battery of individual difference measures not examined in Study 1. Results showed that belief in the entirely fictitious conspiracy theory was significantly associated with stronger belief in other real-world conspiracy theories, stronger paranormal beliefs, and lower crystallized intelligence. These results are discussed in terms of the potential of identifying individual difference constellations among conspiracy theorists.},

Eight-hundred-and-three U.S. adults completed all measures, along with measures of endorsement of 9/11 and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found that only the BCTI had acceptable factorial validity. We failed to confirm the factor structures of the CMQ and the GBCS, suggesting these measures had poor factorial validity. Indices of convergent validity were acceptable for the BCTI, but weaker for the other measures. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions for the future refinement in the measurement of conspiracist ideation.},

In the weak version, it nudges people to think more deeply about their theories, methods, and analyses. We argue against both: the diagnosticity of statistical tests depend entirely on how well statistical models map onto underlying theories, and so improving statistical techniques does little to improve theories when the mapping is weak. There is also little reason to expect that preregistration will spontaneously help researchers to develop better theories (and, hence, better methods and analyses).},

  abstract = {Background: Comorbidity of depression, heart disease, and migraine has been observed in clinical practice, while ambient air pollution has been identified among different risk factors for these health conditions. Suicide attempts and ideations as the result of depression may be linked to air pollution exposure. Therefore the effects of ambient air pollution on emergency department (ED) visits for suicide attempts were investigated. Methods: Emergency visit data were collected in a hospital in Vancouver, Canada. The generalized linear mixed models technique was applied in the analysis of these data. A natural hierarchical structure of the data was used to define the clusters, with days nested in a 3-level structure (day of week, month, year). Poisson models were fitted to the clustered counts of ED visits with a single air pollutant, temperature and relative humidity. In addition, the case-crossover methodology was used with the same data for comparison. The analysis was performed by gender (all, males, females) and month (all: January\textendash December, warm: April\textendash September, cold: October\textendash March). Results: Both hierarchical and case-crossover methods confirmed positive and statistically significant associations among carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM10) for all suicide attempts in the cold period. The largest increase was observed for males in the cold period for a 1-day lagged exposure to NO2, with an excess risk of 23.9\% (95\% CI: 7.8, 42.4) and odds ratio of 1.21 (95\% CI: 1.03, 1.41). In warm months the associations were not statistically significant, and the highest positive value was obtained for ozone lagged by 1 day. Conclusion: The results indicate a potential association between air pollution and emergency department visits for suicide attempts.},

Survey data are used to examine the influence of distinct categories of personal factors (such as attitudes, personal norms, perceived behavior barriers, knowledge) and contextual factors (such as socioeconomic characteristics, living conditions, and store characteristics) on green purchases of Swiss consumers. Results from regression analysis suggest that green food purchases are facilitated by positive attitudes of consumers toward (a) environmental protection, (b) fair trade, (c) local products, and (d) availability of action-related knowledge. In turn, green behavior is negatively associated with (e) perceived time barriers and (f) frequency of shopping in supermarkets. Surprisingly, green purchases are not significantly related to moral thinking, monetary barriers, or the socioeconomic characteristics of the consumers. Implications for policy makers and for companies and marketers engaged in the promotion and commercialization of green products are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

One hundred and forty-seven women completed a baseline measure of trait body image flexibility, followed by a 7-day ecological momentary assessment phase in which participants self-reported state body dissatisfaction, disordered eating behavior, drive for thinness, and appearance comparisons at 10 semi-random intervals daily. Higher trait body image flexibility predicted lower average scores, less frequent reporting of high state body dissatisfaction, and less variability in their state body dissatisfaction ratings. Individuals with higher trait body image flexibility were also less likely to engage in a range of behaviors and cognitions previously shown to produce body dissatisfaction, including upward appearance comparisons, drive for thinness, binge eating, and dieting. However, few of these state-based relationships involving body dissatisfaction and these related behaviors and cognitions were moderated by trait body image flexibility. Overall, this pattern of findings suggests that body image flexible individuals may have less negative body image because they are less inclined to engage in behaviors and cognitions in their daily lives that encourage negative body image.},

  abstract = {Background There appears to be a strong connection between suicidality and the experience of trauma. The study investigated suicidality in chronic civilian post\textendash traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method Ninety\textendash four participants suffering from chronic PTSD were assessed for suicidal ideation, plans and attempts since the index trauma as part of a comprehensive assessment. The prevalence of these was assessed and characteristics of those reporting suicide\textendash related thoughts and behaviour were investigated through logistic and multinominal regression analyses. Results Over half of the sample (56.4\%) reported some aspect of suicidality with 38.3\% reporting ideation, 8.5\% reporting suicide plans and 9.6\% having made suicide attempts since the trauma. Of the nine participants who reported suicide attempts, six had made more than one attempt. The proportions of participants who reported suicidality in this sample were significantly greater than reported within the general population, when comparisons were made with an epidemiological study. Logistic regression analysis indicated that a unit increase in life impairment (OR = 3.1) and depression (OR = 1.14) scores were independently and significantly associated with suicidality. Multinominal regression indicated that life impairment (OR = 2.71) and depression (OR = 1.13) scores were associated with the presence of suicidal ideation compared to no ideation, and life impairment (OR = 5.75), depression (OR = 1.2) scores and receiving psychotropic medication (OR = 10.6) were associated with the presence of plans and attempts compared to no suicidal behaviour. Conclusions Suicide risk is elevated in those suffering from chronic PTSD and is associated with impaired functioning in combination with depression.},

Not only do few commonly used survey instruments reflect efforts to control for method variance, but guides to scale construction encourage researchers to implement strategies that enhance the effects of method variance within measures. In this article, we have argued that when method variance inflates relationships between questionnaire items, traditional psychometric indices overestimate the amount of true or construct variance that scales capture. Implications for survey research that uses fixed alternative questionnaire measures are delineated.},

New directions in research on stressors include examining the differing impacts of stress across a range of physical and mental health outcomes, the "carry-overs" of stress from one role domain or stage of life into another, the benefits derived from negative experiences, and the determinants of the meaning of stressors. Although a sense of personal control and perceived social support influence health and mental health both directly and as stress buffers, the theoretical mechanisms through which they do so still require elaboration and testing. New work suggests that coping flexibility and structural constraints on individuals' coping efforts may be important to pursue. Promising new directions in social support research include studies of the negative effects of social relationships and of support giving, mutual coping and support-giving dynamics, optimal "matches" between individuals' needs and support received, and properties of groups which can provide a sense of social support. Qualitative comparative analysis, optimal matching analysis, and event-structure analysis are new techniques which may help advance research in these broad topic areas. To enhance the effectiveness of coping and social support interventions, intervening mechanisms need to be better understood. Nevertheless, the policy implications of stress research are clear and are important given current interest in health care reform in the United States.},

Prior research has more often examined the effects of voluntary memberships than of volunteer work, has used cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data, and, when longitudinal, has emphasized social causation over selection effects. Focusing only on the consequences of volunteer work overlooks the antecedents of human agency. People with greater personality resources and better physical and mental health should be more likely to seek (or to be sought for) community service. Hence, we examine both selection and social causation effects. Results show that volunteer work indeed enhances all six aspects of well-being and, conversely, people who have greater well-being invest more hours in volunteer service. Given this, further understanding of self- versus social-selection processes seems an important next step. Do positive, healthy people actively seek out volunteer opportunities, or do organizations actively recruit individuals of these types (or both)? Explaining how positive consequences flow from volunteer service may offer a useful counterpoint to stress theory, which has focused primarily on negative life experiences and their sequelae.},

Using data generated from focus groups (N = 62), an expert panel (N = 11), and two surveys (N = 401 and N = 542), we developed and validated an 18-item Workplace Dignity Scale (WDS). Our studies reveal evidence in support of the WDS' psychometric properties, as well as its content, construct, and criterion-related validity. Our structural models support predictive relationships between workplace characteristics (e.g., dirty work, income insufficiency) and dignity. Moreover, we observed the incremental validity of workplace dignity to account for variance in employee engagement, burnout, and turnover intentions above and beyond the explanatory effects of organizational respect and meaningful work. These results demonstrate the promise of the WDS for organizational research.},

  abstract = {Background Suicide is one of the leading causes of premature mortality worldwide. Few studies have assessed long-term trends or sex differences in its incidence over time. We have investigated the age-, sex- and method-specific trends in suicide in England and Wales from 1861 to 2007. Methods Overall age-standardized suicide rates using the European Standard Population and age-, sex- and method-specific rates were calculated for ages {$\geq$}15 years from 1861 to 2007. Results Rates in males were consistently higher than females throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, although the male-to-female sex ratio fluctuated from 4 : 1 in the 1880s to 1.5 : 1 in the 1960s. Suicide rates increased in all age groups in the 1930s, coinciding with the Great Depression. The highest male rates (30.3 per 100 000) were recorded in 1905 and 1934 and have since been declining. Female rates peaked in the 1960s (11.8 per 100 000), declining afterwards. In both sexes the lowest recorded rates were in the 21st century. There was a rapid rise in the use of domestic gas as a method of suicide in both sexes following its introduction at the end of the 19th century. There was no evidence that this rise was accompanied by a decline in the use of other methods. Self-poisoning also increased in popularity from the 1860s (5\% of suicides) to the 1990s (22\% of suicides). Conclusions The epidemiology of suicide in England and Wales has changed markedly over the past 146 years. The rapid rise in gas suicide deaths in the 1920s highlights how quickly a new method of suicide can be established in a population when it is easily available. The increase in suicides during the Great Depression has implications in relation to the current economic crisis. Changes in the acceptability and lethality of various suicide methods may account for the large variations in sex ratios over time.},

Researchers who use this typology have considered changes at state A (time 1) and state B (time 2) but have not examined the process involved for Alpha, Beta, and Gamma change in moving from state A to state B. To move inside this black box, we develop a model of attitude and structure and examine the cognitive processes hypothesized to yield attitude structure changes corresponding to the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma typology. We develop testable research propositions and show how the model can help to guide future research and practical applications across a wide range of interventions.},

Rarely has the duration of sunlight exposure or any other weather parameter been quantitated in studies of suicide seasonality. To explore the relationships between sunlight and suicide, we examined California weather and suicide data from 1968 to 1977. Los Angeles County and Sacramento County were well-suited to the investigation, as complete data were available for these large population centers. There was no evidence of seasonality to suicides in L.A. County or Sacramento, despite a pronounced seasonality to weather. To investigate the acute temporal effects of weather on suicides, all occurences of 10 successive above- or below-average sunshine days were identified. Suicides for intervals of 5 days were then compared by Mann-Whitney analyses for 25 days after the selected intervals. For L.A. County, there were no significant findings. For Sacramento County, however, there was evidence for sunlight inhibition of suicides at days 21-25 after the above-average sunshine. Suicides after 10 days of below-average sunshine were increased as much as 70\% about the 10-year average. Further replication studies with larger data sets are needed for an adequate examination of the correspondences of suicide data and weather measurements.},

A comparative simulation study examines the quality of various estimated component loading CIs. The bootstrap approach is more flexible and generally yields better CIs than the asymptotic approach. However, in the case of a clear simple structure of varimax rotated loadings, one can be confident that the asymptotic estimates are reasonable as well.},

  abstract = {I review the literature on the economic impacts of climate change, an externality that is unprecedentedly large, complex, and uncertain. Only 14 estimates of the total damage cost of climate change have been published, a research effort that is in sharp contrast to the urgency of the public debate and the proposed expenditure on greenhouse gas emission reduction. These estimates show that climate change initially improves economic welfare. However, these benefits are sunk. Impacts would be predominantly negative later in the century. Global average impacts would be comparable to the welfare loss of a few percent of income, but substantially higher in poor countries. Still, the impact of climate change over a century is comparable to economic growth over a few years. There are over 200 estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is large and right-skewed. For a standard discount rate, the expected value is \$50/tC, which is much lower than the price of carbon in the European Union but much higher than the price of carbon elsewhere. Current estimates of the damage costs of climate change are incomplete, with positive and negative biases. Most important among the missing impacts are the indirect effects of climate change on economic development; large-scale biodiversity loss; low-probability, high-impact scenarios; the impact of climate change on violent conflict; and the impacts of climate change beyond 2100. From a welfare perspective, the impact of climate change is problematic because population is endogenous, and because policy analyses should separate impatience, risk aversion, and inequity aversion between and within countries.},

The suicidal rate might have been influenced by climatic and seasonal triggering factors. In this study 4918 suicidal cases (3099 male, 1819 female) in Budapest were investigated in connection with climatic data, as daily maximum, minimum temperature, and air humidity. The most frequent methods of suicide were intoxication, hanging and jumping. A mild seasonal variation was found, however, the rate of suicidal death was influenced by warm temperatures. Higher frequency of suicidal deaths was detected in warm weather with low relative humidity, which implies dominantly dry anticyclonic meteorological conditions. Our results suggest that the medico-legal investigation may help specific suicide prevention programme regarding to the climate change and meteorological conditions as potential risk factors of suicidal cases.},

  abstract = {There are many idiosyncrasies in the emotion of regret that we do not fully comprehend and our traditional reliance on economic theories of human decision-making, which view regret as stemming from illogical and explicit decision-making processes, may be the cause. This thesis explores the development and testing of the Dual Process Theory of Regret (DPTR) which claims that individuals use both implicit `orientation' and explicit `justification' systems of thought to guide their daily decision-making and the differential use of these systems should be reflected in the intensity of regret felt for a poor outcome. To assess its utility in predicting variation in regret intensity the DPTR was tested in conjunction with two popular theories of regret; one focussing on the distinction between actions and inaction, and the other focussing on decision justification. Three thousand adults were randomly selected from the New Zealand electoral roll and invited to participate in a postal survey of short and long-term life regrets. Of this initial sample 653 participants returned questionnaires with usable data, a response rate of approximately 23\% which, while a relatively low response rate, was expected given the sensitive topic and provided more than enough respondents for the present analysis. Results showed that the DPTR had greater utility in predicting trends in short and long-term regret intensity than either of the current regret theories. Results also illustrated that changes in justification strength had little effect on regret intensity and that explicit justifications only influenced regret in the long-term. In contrast results supported the conceptualisation of the implicit orientation and showed that it was a key source of influence on regret intensity in both the short and long-term. This research concludes that the DPTR's focus on both implicit and explicit cognitive systems provides greater insight into the nature of regret than the reliance on explicit cognitive analysis alone. Implicit feelings of right and wrong are a better indicator of eventual regret than our ability to justify our decision. These results help resolve past anomalies in regret research, clarify conflicting trends in regret highlighted in the current media, and have application for understanding criminal recidivism.},

Variables hypothesised to affect the intensity of regret include: whether the regretted decision was an action or an inaction, the degree to which the decision was justified, and the life domain of the regret. No previous study has compared the effects of these key predictors in a single model in order to identify which are most strongly associated with the intensity of life regret. In this study, respondents (N = 500) to a postal survey answered questions concerning the nature of their greatest life regret. A Bayesian regression analysis suggested that regret intensity was greater for\textemdash in order of importance\textemdash decisions that breached participants' personal life rules, decisions in social life domains than non-social domains, and decisions that lacked an explicit justification.

As the standard null-hypothesis significance-testing procedure does just that, it is logically invalid (J. Cohen, 1994). Theoretically, Bayes's theorem yields [ p ( H {$_0$}/F)], but in practice, researchers rarely know the correct values for 2 of the variables in the theorem. Nevertheless, by considering a wide range of possible values for the unknown variables, it is possible to calculate a range of theoretical values for [ p ( H {$_0$}/F)] and to draw conclusions about both hypothesis testing and theory evaluation.

Headlines attributing an event solely to either human-induced climate change or natural variability can be misleading when both are invariably in play. The conventional attribution framework struggles with dynamically driven extremes because of the small signal-to-noise ratios and often uncertain nature of the forced changes. Here, we suggest that a different framing is desirable, which asks why such extremes unfold the way they do. Specifically, we suggest that it is more useful to regard the extreme circulation regime or weather event as being largely unaffected by climate change, and question whether known changes in the climate system's thermodynamic state affected the impact of the particular event. Some examples briefly illustrated include 'snowmaggedon' in February 2010, superstorm Sandy in October 2012 and supertyphoon Haiyan in November 2013, and, in more detail, the Boulder floods of September 2013, all of which were influenced by high sea surface temperatures that had a discernible human component.},

The current research offers one possible account for this backfire effect (i.e., the ironic strengthening of belief in erroneous information after an attempted refutation) from an educational psychology perspective and examines whether emotions mediate the relationship between self-concept and learning from refutation texts. In an experimental design, 120 undergraduate students responded to a questionnaire focused on their dietary self-concept and were randomly assigned to read an expository or refutation text on the topic of genetically modified foods. Immediately after reading, participants self-reported their emotions followed by completing post-test measures of their knowledge and attitudes of the topic. Results showed an interaction between self-concept and text condition on emotions wherein self-concept predicted negative emotions (i.e., confusion, anxiety, frustration) while reading a refutation text specifically. Further, negative emotions significantly mediated relations between self-concept and post-test knowledge and attitudes. Implications for educational design and future research are discussed.},

Pearson's correlation coefficients between variables were calculated, and stepwise multiple regression analysis was conducted. Results: Percentage of the spouseless and elderly population, labor participation rate, unemployment rate, and densities of newspapers and personal computer were significantly associated with suicide rate. Multiple regression chose spouseless population, labor participation rate, and unemployment rate to explain 96.1\% of the variance of the suicide rate (F(3,22) = 178.996, p = 0.000). Conclusions: Socioe-conomic factors are important for the secular trend of suicide, while medium densities also play some roles. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Five socioeconomic (sex ratio, no spouse, aged, unemployment and low income) and three climatic (temperature, rainfall and sunshine) factors were identified as significant, explaining 59.0\% of the variance in the total suicide death rate. `Without spouse' and `aged' were associated with the highest risk, while `low income with financial aids' was strongly protective. The most influential climatic factor was `temperature,' which was negatively correlated with suicide. `Sunshine' was positively associated with suicide. The socioeconomic and climatic factors contributed 52.7\% and 6.8\%, respectively, to the variance of the total suicide death rate. Limitations of the study included the fact that no individual events were considered, the study was of relatively short duration and it was confined to the territory of Taiwan. Socioeconomic factors outweighed climatic factors in explaining regional differences in the suicide death rate in Taiwan. Temperature weighed more than sunshine. `Thermotherapy' seems more clinically relevant than the popular light therapy, at least in Taiwan.},

The present study aimed to examine the relationships between suicidal seasonality and the climate as well as the economic factors.  Methods  The monthly suicide death rates of the total, male and female populations in Taiwan during January 1991\textendash December 2010 were obtained from the population-based database. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) / seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) was used to analyze suicidal seasonality, with monthly ambient temperature, temperature increase, rainfall, sunlight, unemployment and labor force participation rates as the independent inputs.  Results  The models revealed that monthly temperature increase was strongly positively associated with seasonality of suicide rates of all populations ({$\beta$} = 0.0184, P \&lt; 0.001; {$\beta$} = 0.0234, P = 0.001; {$\beta$} = 0.0145, P \&lt; 0.001, respectively). Rainfall was significantly negatively associated with the total and male suicide rates ({$\beta$} = - 0.0001, P = 0.012; {$\beta$} = - 0.0002, P = 0.043, respectively), but not with female. Unemployment and labor force participation rates were not significantly related to their corresponding suicide rates.  Limitations  Socio-demographic data, individual major events, and subgroups by suicide methods were not taken into account.  Conclusions  The results indicate that, as far as suicidal seasonality is concerned, monthly temperature increase is the most influential factor, and climatic factors have more significant effect than the economic factors.},

This paper provides a critical overview of the evidence that current melting of ice will increase the frequency or size of hazardous volcanic eruptions. Many aspects of the link between ice recession and accelerated volcanic activity remain poorly understood. Key questions include how rapidly volcanic systems react to melting of ice, whether volcanoes are sensitive to small changes in ice thickness and how recession of ice affects the generation, storage and eruption of magma at stratovolcanoes. A greater frequency of collapse events at glaciated stratovolcanoes can be expected in the near future, and there is strong potential for positive feedbacks between melting of ice and enhanced volcanism. Nonetheless, much further research is required to remove current uncertainties about the implications of climate change for volcanic hazards in the twenty-first century.},

Very little attention will be given to how the results can be calculated--after all, there are books about that (e.g., Miller, 1966, 1981; Hochberg and Tamhane, 1987).},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine whether a six-session group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) programme results in a greater reduction in depression symptoms than a brief intervention alone in cardiac patients with clinically significant symptoms of depression. Method: Fifty-seven community dwelling cardiac patients scoring {$>$}13 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) received a single-session brief intervention. They were then block randomised to either six sessions of group CBT (n = 25) or no further intervention (BI; n = 32). All were re-assessed at 2, 6 and 12 months. Differences between treatment groups in the primary (BDI-II) and secondary [rates of depression; anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A)] outcomes were examined using generalised linear mixed models with a random intercept term for the individual. Results: Significant improvements were seen for the total group from baseline to 12 months on BDI-II and HADS-A scores. However, no differences were found between the CBT and BI conditions on change in BDI-II score, rates of major depressive episode or HADS-A score. Post hoc analysis on the total group found 12-month symptom non-remission was associated with higher baseline BDI-II score (p = 0.03), more visits to health professionals 12 months prior to baseline (p = 0.05) and a greater likelihood of either drinking alcohol over recommended levels or smoking at baseline (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Group CBT of up to six sessions did not result in greater reductions in depression or anxiety symptoms compared with a single-session brief intervention. Further work should focus on the efficacy and role of brief interventions, and addressing smoking and alcohol misuse in cardiac patients with depression.},

To better understand the criteria distinguishing credit from luck, we conducted a series of four studies on knowledge attributions. Knowledge is an achievement that involves reaching the truth. But many factors affecting the truth are beyond our control, and reaching the truth is often partly due to luck. Which sorts of luck are compatible with knowledge? We found that knowledge attributions are highly sensitive to lucky events that change the explanation for why a belief is true. By contrast, knowledge attributions are surprisingly insensitive to lucky events that threaten, but ultimately fail to change the explanation for why a belief is true. These results shed light on our concept of knowledge, help explain apparent inconsistencies in prior work on knowledge attributions, and constitute progress toward a general understanding of the relation between success and luck.},

The average American child in the 1980s reported more anxiety than child psychiatric patients in the 1950s. Correlations with social indices (e.g., divorce rates, crime rates) suggest that decreases in social connectedness and increases in environmental dangers may be responsible for the rise in anxiety. Economic factors, however, seem to play little role. Birth cohort, as a proxy for broad social trends, may be an important influence on personality development, especially during childhood.},

It then outlines the roles of personal and social motivations, institutional decisions, the public culture, and technology in establishing consensual guidelines for ignorance. The upshot is a sociological model of how the "knowledge society" militates against the acquisition of scientific knowledge. Given the assumption of widespread scientific illiteracy, the paper tries to show why the ozone hole was capable of engendering some public understanding and concern, while climate change failed to do so. The ozone threat encouraged the acquisition of knowledge because it was allied and resonated with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture. It also engendered a "hot crisis." That is, it provided a sense of immediate and concrete risk with everyday relevance. Climate change fails at both of these criteria and remains in a public limbo.},

In this article, we introduce basic concepts and methods from the study of nonlinear dynamical systems, and we outline the relevance of these ideas and approaches for investigating phenomena at different levels of psychological reality. We suggest that the dynamical perspective is ideally suited to capture the emergence and maintenance of global properties in a psychological system, and for investigating the time-dependent relation between external influences and a system's internally generated forces. Although fairly new to personality and social psychology, the dynamical perspective has been implemented with respect to a wide variety of phenomena, utilizing both empirical methods and computer simulations.

The framework is an outgrowth of models from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, USA, designed for Earth's atmosphere, but it may readily be extended into other planetary regimes. Various forcing and radiation options are available, from dry, time invariant, Newtonian thermal relaxation to moist dynamics with radiative transfer. Options are available in the dry thermal relaxation scheme to account for the effects of obliquity and eccentricity (and so seasonality), different atmospheric optical depths and a surface mixed layer. An idealized grey radiation scheme, a two-band scheme, and a multiband scheme are also available, all with simple moist effects and astronomically based solar forcing. At the complex end of the spectrum the framework provides a direct connection to comprehensive atmospheric general circulation models.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}For Earth modelling, options include an aquaplanet and configurable continental outlines and topography. Continents may be defined by changing albedo, heat capacity, and evaporative parameters and/or by using a simple bucket hydrology model. Oceanic \emph{Q} fluxes may be added to reproduce specified sea surface temperatures, with arbitrary continental distributions. Planetary atmospheres may be configured by changing planetary size and mass, solar forcing, atmospheric mass, radiation, and other parameters. Examples are given of various Earth configurations as well as a giant planet simulation, a slowly rotating terrestrial planet simulation, and tidally locked and other orbitally resonant exoplanet simulations.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The underlying model is written in Fortran and may largely be configured with Python scripts. Python scripts are also used to run the model on different architectures, to archive the output, and for diagnostics, graphics, and post-processing. All of these features are publicly available in a Git-based repository.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background The association of mental disorders with time patterns of attempted suicide is poorly understood.Methods The study material consisted of all consecutive suicide attempts admitted to health care in Helsinki during a one-year period from 15 January 1997 to 14 January 1998. Clinical diagnosis was made according to ICD-10.Results Overall, the rate of suicide attempts varied markedly during the study period, peaking in autumn and being lowest during winter. Substance use disorders best explained suicide attempts occurring at weekends. There was considerable temporal variation among patients with mood disorders, compared to only slight variation among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Study subjects tended to contact health services in the late evening and around midnight. Those contacting health services outside normal hours received psychiatric consultation less frequently than others and were referred to aftercare less often.Limitations Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis I and II Disorders were not used.Conclusions There were marked time patterns of attempted suicide, especially among patients with mood disorders and substance use disorders. This contrasted with the limited fluctuation among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Contacts with the health care system occurred most often in the late evening and around midnight. The findings question the adequacy of staff numbers for psychiatric consultations and of time to plan aftercare.},

This paper provides an overview of the relation between climate change and weather extremes, and examines three specific cases where recent acute events have stimulated debate on the potential role of climate change: the European heatwave of 2003; the risk of inland flooding, such as recently in Central Europe and Great Britain; and the harsh Atlantic hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005. Furthermore, it briefly assesses the relation between climate change and El Ni\~no, and the potential of abrupt climate change. Several trends in weather extremes are sufficiently clear to inform risk reduction efforts. In many instances, however, the potential increases in extreme events due to climate change come on top of alarming rises in vulnerability. Hence, the additional risks due to climate change should not be analysed or treated in isolation, but instead integrated into broader efforts to reduce the risk of natural disasters.},

Whereas latent variable approaches introduce unobserved common causes to explain the relations among observed variables, network approaches posit direct causal relations between observed variables. While these approaches lead to radically different understandings of the psychological constructs of interest, recent articles have established mathematical equivalences that hold between network models and latent variable models. We argue that the fact that for any model from one class there is an equivalent model from the other class does not mean that both models are equally plausible accounts of the data-generating mechanism. In many cases the constraints that are meaningful in one framework translate to constraints in the equivalent model that lack a clear interpretation in the other framework. Finally, we discuss three diverging predictions for the relation between zero-order correlations and partial correlations implied by sparse network models and unidimensional factor models. We propose a test procedure that compares the likelihoods of these models in light of these diverging implications. We use an empirical example to illustrate our argument.},

We conducted a case-control survey and defined cases as people aged 65 years and older who lived at home and died from August 8 through August 13 from causes other than accident, suicide, or surgical complications. Controls were matched with cases for age, sex, and residential area. Interviewers used questionnaires to collect data. Satellite pictures provided profiles of the heat island characteristics around the homes. Lack of mobility was a major risk factor along with some pre-existing medical conditions. Housing characteristics associated with death were lack of thermal insulation and sleeping on the top floor, right under the roof. The temperature around the building was a major risk factor. Behaviour such as dressing lightly and use of cooling techniques and devices were protective factors. These findings suggest people with pre-existing medical conditions were likely to be vulnerable during heat waves and need information on how to adjust daily routines to heat waves. In the long term, building insulation and urban planning must be adapted to provide protection from possible heat waves.},

Respondents (N = 454) were randomly allocated to four different conditions (an information-only, social norm-only, a combination of both, or a control group). It was hypothesized that the combination (i.e., norm-induced information provision) would be most persuasive and elicit the greatest reduction in intentions to buy bottled water. Results were consistent with this hypothesis. Findings also show that while beliefs about health, taste, water quality, lifestyle, the environment, and perceived alternatives are all correlated with bottled water consumption, belief strength varies significantly based on rate of consumption.},

Specifically, we conducted a consensus message experiment on a national quota sample of the US population (N = 6,301). Results support the mediational hypotheses of the GBM: an experimentally induced change in perceived scientific consensus causes subsequent changes in cognitive (belief) and affective (worry) judgments about climate change, which in turn are associated with changes in support for public action. The scientific consensus message also had a direct effect on support for public action. We further found an interaction with both political ideology and prior attitudes such that conservatives and climate change disbelievers were more likely to update their beliefs toward the consensus. We discuss the model's theoretical and practical implications, including why conveying scientific consensus can help reduce politically motivated reasoning.},

Yet, in light of the increasing politicization of (climate) science, and the attempts of vested-interest groups to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change through organized ``disinformation campaigns,'' identifying ways to effectively engage with the public about the issue across the political spectrum has proven difficult. A growing body of research suggests that one promising way to counteract the politicization of science is to convey the high level of normative agreement (``consensus'') among experts about the reality of human-caused climate change. Yet, much prior research examining public opinion dynamics in the context of climate change has done so under conditions with limited external validity. Moreover, no research to date has examined how to protect the public from the spread of influential misinformation about climate change. The current research bridges this divide by exploring how people evaluate and process consensus cues in a polarized information environment. Furthermore, evidence is provided that it is possible to pre-emptively protect (``inoculate'') public attitudes about climate change against real-world misinformation.},

Moreover, previous research has identified important associations between public perceptions of the scientific consensus, belief in climate change and support for climate policy. This paper extends this line of research by advancing and providing experimental evidence for a ``gateway belief model'' (GBM). Using national data (N = 1104) from a consensus-message experiment, we find that increasing public perceptions of the scientific consensus is significantly and causally associated with an increase in the belief that climate change is happening, human-caused and a worrisome threat. In turn, changes in these key beliefs are predictive of increased support for public action. In short, we find that perceived scientific agreement is an important gateway belief, ultimately influencing public responses to climate change.},

Method: In this cross-sectional survey, data from 527 family members of people with a mental illness were analyzed. Results: Perceptions of public stigma were found to be positively related to SBA and SBA correlated with greater psychological distress and less perceived closeness. SBA also mediated relationships between perceived public stigma and psychological distress, and between perceived public stigma and perceived closeness. Further, among participants who reported SBA, immediate family members showed lower levels of perceived closeness than extended family members. Also, the perceived heredity of mental illness was associated with perceptions of public stigma and psychological distress. Conclusion: The findings suggest that family members of people with a mental illness could benefit from education on mental illnesses, their treatment, and the extent to which they are hereditary. Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the psychological needs that arise from being a caregiver of someone with a mental illness.

Through semi-structured interviews, we investigated experiences of stigma by association among 23 immediate family members of people with mental illness.

Familial relationship, co-residence, and the gender of participants appeared to play a role in their stigma experiences; parents and spouses reported different manifestations of stigma by association than siblings and children, participants who lived together with their family member with mental illness reported increased experiences of stigma by association, and in contrast to male participants, female participants reported others thinking they are overprotective and as such perpetuated, maintained, or sustained their family members' mental illness. The relevance of these factors points to the need for tailored education and emotional support provision to family members of people with mental illness.

Interaction and effect modification are formally defined within the counterfactual framework. Interaction is defined in terms of the effects of 2 interventions whereas effect modification is defined in terms of the effect of one intervention varying across strata of a second variable. Effect modification can be present with no interaction; interaction can be present with no effect modification. There are settings in which it is possible to assess effect modification but not interaction, or to assess interaction but not effect modification. The analytic procedures for obtaining estimates of effect modification parameters and interaction parameters using marginal structural models are compared and contrasted. A characterization is given of the settings in which interaction and effect modification coincide.},

We argue that more can be learned from data by evaluating informative hypotheses, than by testing the traditional null hypothesis. All criticisms of classical null hypothesis testing aside, the best argument for evaluating informative hypotheses is that many researchers want to evaluate their expectations directly, but have been unable to do so because the statistical tools were not yet available. It will be shown that a Bayesian model selection procedure can be used to evaluate informative hypotheses in structural equation models using the software Mplus. In the current paper we introduce the methodology using a real-life example taken from the field of developmental psychology about depressive symptoms in adolescence and provide a step-by-step description so that the procedure becomes more comprehensible for applied researchers. As this paper illustrates, this methodology is ready to be used by any researcher within the social sciences.},

Eleven synoptic categories were related to daily mortality rates in Sydney. Two distinctive warm categories were associated with significantly higher mortality rates. Hot, dry and relatively rare Synoptic Category 7 (SC7) days showed the highest daily mortality rates, followed by warm and humid SC3 days, which occurred more frequently. Increased mortality was more pronounced among the elderly population, and gender-stratified analysis showed women to be more vulnerable. Mortality on the day of the weather event was higher than 1 or 2 days after the adverse synoptic situation. Ozone and particulate matter smaller than 10 \textmu m were found at high concentrations in SC3 and SC7, respectively, but their impact on mortality was not clear. The population of Sydney was found to be vulnerable to high temperatures, with a lower susceptibility than those of some cities in the USA and Europe.},

We studied eight normal weight healthy females, 48 h at an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C, and 48 h at 27 degrees C. Energy expenditure (EE) was measured in a respiration chamber. Subjects' skin temperature was measured continuously from 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m.: forehead, infraclavicular zone, thigh, hand, and foot. Core temperature was determined tympanically. Body composition was determined by under water weighing. Exposure to 27 degrees C caused a significant increase in body temperature (both skin and core), a decrease in temperature gradients, and a decrease in energy expenditure. At 27 degrees C 24 h EE, adjusted for body composition, was significantly related to body tympanic temperature. The decrease in 24 h EE, at 27 degrees C ambient temperature, was significantly, negatively related to the increase in T(tym), indicating individual responses in adaptation to elevated ambient temperature. Changes in temperature gradient (comparing 27 degrees C with 22 degrees C) were negatively related to changes in EE. This shows that individuals differ in their response to an increase in environmental temperature regarding the relative contribution of insulative or metabolic adjustments.},

This paper argues that, when dealing with psychological models that are quantitatively instantiated theories, being sensitive to the prior is an attractive feature of a model evaluation measure. This assertion follows from the observation that in psychological models parameters are not completely unknown, but correspond to psychological variables about which theory often exists. This theory can be formally captured in the prior range and prior distribution of the parameters, indicating which parameter values are allowed, likely, unlikely and forbidden. Because the prior is a vehicle for expressing psychological theory, it should, like the model equation, be considered as an integral part of the model. It is argued that the combined practice of building models using informative priors, and evaluating models using prior sensitive measures advances knowledge.},

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5 \texttimes{} 0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

For this purpose, variants of both coping styles were studied in a naturalistic setting: 37 women who underwent prenatal diagnosis were interviewed at home about their ways of coping with different stages of the procedure, a few days before they expected the diagnostic results. Interview fragments pertaining to cognitive confrontation and avoidance were selected and analysed by two investigators in order to generate categories of avoidance and confrontation coping strategies. For some of the fragments, inter judge reliability was assessed using new judges. A comparison between the categories found and the kinds of items used in the MBSS shows that in real life more coping variants occur than those represented in the MBSS, in particular variants that involve a combination of cognitive confrontation and avoidance. Implications for the dimensionality of both concepts and for their measurement are discussed.},

The information provided was based on self-regulation theory, and patients could restrict themselves to reading the summary only.Methods Patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group receiving the brochure at least 1 day before the gastroscopy (N = 47), or to a control group not receiving the brochure (N = 48).Results The results show that all experimental subjects, except one, fully read the brochure. Those receiving the brochure experienced less anxiety before the gastroscopy and, afterwards, they reported greater satisfaction with the preparation for it. With regard to coping style there were some small moderating effects into the direction expected: low blunters (those not seeking distraction under impending threat) as compared to high blunters showed extra reduced anxiety after reading the brochure. They also tended to read the brochure more often. High monitors (those seeking information under impending threat) receiving the brochure showed reduced anxiety during the gastroscopy as compared to low monitors (tendency).Conclusion We conclude that providing patients with the developed brochure constitutes an efficient, beneficial intervention.Practice implications The brochure could easily be implemented in standard practice without the necessity to take the patient's coping style into account.},

  abstract = {Background There is wide agreement in the biomedical research community that research data sharing is a primary ingredient for ensuring that science is more transparent and reproducible. Publishers could play an important role in facilitating and enforcing data sharing; however, many journals have not yet implemented data sharing policies and the requirements vary widely across journals. This study set out to analyze the pervasiveness and quality of data sharing policies in the biomedical literature. Methods The online author's instructions and editorial policies for 318 biomedical journals were manually reviewed to analyze the journal's data sharing requirements and characteristics. The data sharing policies were ranked using a rubric to determine if data sharing was required, recommended, required only for omics data, or not addressed at all. The data sharing method and licensing recommendations were examined, as well any mention of reproducibility or similar concepts. The data was analyzed for patterns relating to publishing volume, Journal Impact Factor, and the publishing model (open access or subscription) of each journal. Results A total of 11.9\% of journals analyzed explicitly stated that data sharing was required as a condition of publication. A total of 9.1\% of journals required data sharing, but did not state that it would affect publication decisions. 23.3\% of journals had a statement encouraging authors to share their data but did not require it. A total of 9.1\% of journals mentioned data sharing indirectly, and only 14.8\% addressed protein, proteomic, and/or genomic data sharing. There was no mention of data sharing in 31.8\% of journals. Impact factors were significantly higher for journals with the strongest data sharing policies compared to all other data sharing criteria. Open access journals were not more likely to require data sharing than subscription journals. Discussion Our study confirmed earlier investigations which observed that only a minority of biomedical journals require data sharing, and a significant association between higher Impact Factors and journals with a data sharing requirement. Moreover, while 65.7\% of the journals in our study that required data sharing addressed the concept of reproducibility, as with earlier investigations, we found that most data sharing policies did not provide specific guidance on the practices that ensure data is maximally available and reusable.},

The sample comprised 961 subjects representative of the non-institutionalized Norwegian adult population. Using an EFA strategy, very high coefficients of factor comparability (r=0.93\textendash 0.99) across sexes were found. None of the five main domains turned out to be as homogeneous as suggested by the original five-factor model, but most of the deviations from the assumed simple structure were comparable to results from recent American studies. However, none of the revised EFA-based models were supported using CFA methods. Moreover, a large number of modifications were necessary to obtain a model with acceptable fit. It is argued that these discrepant findings can be accounted for, at least in part, by (i) consequences of different model acceptance criteria in the EFA and CFA tradition, (ii) the inherent logical\textendash semantical structure of the NEO-PI, and (iii) consequences of selection effects (factorial invariance problem). \textcopyright{} 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The credibility revolution (sometimes referred to as the "replicability crisis") in psychology has brought about many changes in the standards by which psychological science is evaluated. These changes include (a) greater emphasis on transparency and openness, (b) a move toward preregistration of research, (c) more direct-replication studies, and (d) higher standards for the quality and quantity of evidence needed to make strong scientific claims. What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress-the most important shared goal of scientists-is likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one's subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer.},

  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is examine biological and psychosocial factors that contribute to the development of gender-variant or gender-typical identities. Blanchard's autogynephilia theory (Blanchard, 1989b) suggests that these factors are different in birth-assigned males with different sexual orientations. Previous research has found that genetics, prenatal hormone exposure, neuroanatomy, handedness, dermatoglyphics, fraternal birth order, and abuse are related to gender identity. While a number of investigators have studied these variables individually, this is the first known study to have examined the inter-relationships of these variables in one sample and to include participants with a wide range of gender identities. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 2,277 online-recruited participants with gender-variant and gender-typical identities using an online questionnaire. Participants were mainly white/Caucasian (92\%) adults living in the USA (54\%) and New Zealand (19\%). From the results, reported family concordance for gender-variance and a systematic review of case reports of twins with gender-variant identities indicated genetic determinants of gender identities. Finger-length ratio, systemising, and a systematic review of case-reports of gender identity outcomes for adults with intersex and related conditions indicated prenatal hormone determinants of gender identities. Further evidence for biological factors came from elevated levels of non-right handedness among birth-assigned females with gender-variant identities. Structural equation modelling showed that the positive relationship between abuse experience and degree of adult gender-variance was partially mediated by recalled childhood gender-variance. This suggests abuse may be a cause as well as a result of gender-variance. Contrary to Blanchard's theory, there were no differences in biological and psychosocial factors between birth-assigned male participants of different sexual orientations. This was the first research to find evidence that biological and psychosocial factors are the same for transsexuals as for persons with other gender-variant identities. Overall, these findings add support for a biological predisposition for gender-variant and gender-typical identities. Psychosocial determinants are likely to be complex and work in interaction with biological factors.},

There is evidence that the original instructions and response options are difficult to understand. Using simplified instructions and response options, the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was administered on a sample of 1514 participants using an online questionnaire. In accordance with previous research, a model of the 10-item inventory had poor fit for the data. This study also detected model misspecification in the previously-proposed 7-item modification. A 4-item Edinburgh Handedness Inventory \textendash{} Short Form had good model fit with items modelled as both continuous and ordinal. Despite its brevity, it showed very good reliability, factor score determinacy, and correlation with scores on the 10-item inventory. By eliminating items that were modelled with considerable measurement error, the short form alleviates the concern of the 10-item inventory over-categorising mixed handers. Evidence was found for factorial invariance across level of education, age groups, and regions (USA and Australia/New Zealand). There generally appeared to be invariance across genders for the 4-item inventory. The proposed Edinburgh Handedness Inventory \textendash{} Short Form measures a single handedness factor with an inventory that has brief and simple instructions and a small number of items.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the factorial validity of a short version of Zucker et al.'s (2006) ``Recalled Childhood Gender Identity/Gender Role Questionnaire'' using confirmatory factor analysis and to test the stability of the factor structure across groups (measurement invariance). Six items of the questionnaire were completed online by 1929 participants from a variety of gender identity and sexual orientation groups. Models of the six items loading onto one factor had poor fit for the data. Items were removed for having a large proportion of error variance. Among birth-assigned females, a five-item model had good fit for the data, but there was evidence for differences in scale's factor structure across gender identity, age, level of education, and country groups. Among birth-assigned males, the resulting four-item model did not account for all of the relationship between variables, and modeling for this resulted in a model that was almost saturated. This model also had evidence of measurement variance across gender identity and sexual orientation groups. The models had good reliability and factor score determinacy. These findings suggest that results of previous studies that have assessed recalled childhood gender role/identity may have been susceptible to construct bias due to measurement variance across these groups. Future studies should assess measurement invariance between groups they are comparing, and if it is not found the issue can be addressed by removing variant indicators and/or applying a partial invariance model.},

Measures include those based solely on the maximized likelihoods with and without the restriction that slope coefficients are zero, those which require further calculations based on parameter estimates of the coefficients and variances and those that are based solely on whether the qualitative predictions of the model are correct or not. The theme of the survey is that while there is no obvious criterion for choosing which Pseudo-R2 to use, if the estimation is in the context of an underlying latent dependent variable model, a case can be made for basing the choice on the strength of the numerical relationship to the OLS-R2 in the latent dependent variable. As such an OLS-R2 can be known in a Monte Carlo simulation, we summarize Monte Carlo results for some important latent dependent variable models (binary probit, ordinal probit and Tobit) and find that a Pseudo-R2 measure due to McKelvey and Zavoina scores consistently well under our criterion. We also very briefly discuss Pseudo-R2 measures for count data, for duration models and for prediction-realization tables.},

Three errors occurred in the Examples section. The errors are corrected in the erratum, and a more detailed description of the errata can be found on http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0038326.supp] Replication attempts are essential to the empirical sciences. Successful replication attempts increase researchers' confidence in the presence of an effect, whereas failed replication attempts induce skepticism and doubt. However, it is often unclear to what extent a replication attempt results in success or failure. To quantify replication outcomes we propose a novel Bayesian replication test that compares the adequacy of 2 competing hypotheses. The 1st hypothesis is that of the skeptic and holds that the effect is spurious; this is the null hypothesis that postulates a zero effect size, H{$_0$} : {$\delta$} = 0. The 2nd hypothesis is that of the proponent and holds that the effect is consistent with the one found in the original study, an effect that can be quantified by a posterior distribution. Hence, the 2nd hypothesis\textemdash the replication hypothesis\textemdash is given by Hr : {$\delta$} {$\sim$} ``posterior distribution from original study.'' The weighted-likelihood ratio between H{$_0$} and Hr quantifies the evidence that the data provide for replication success and failure. In addition to the new test, we present several other Bayesian tests that address different but related questions concerning a replication study. These tests pertain to the independent conclusions of the separate experiments, the difference in effect size between the original experiment and the replication attempt, and the overall conclusion based on the pooled results. Together, this suite of Bayesian tests allows a relatively complete formalization of the way in which the result of a replication attempt alters our knowledge of the phenomenon at hand. The use of all Bayesian replication tests is illustrated with 3 examples from the literature. For experiments analyzed using the t test, computation of the new replication test only requires the t values and the numbers of participants from the original study and the replication study.

  abstract = {This study investigates determinants of sustainable food consumer behaviour in Belgium. To gain a better insight in sustainable consumption, a study was conducted in which attitudes and behaviour as well as the role of individual characteristics like confidence and values related to sustainable products are analyzed. The focus of the analysis is on exploring the influence of determinants as hypothesised by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) \textendash{} attitudes, perceived behavioural control, social norms \textendash{} on sustainable consumption intention in general, and specifically depending on consumer's perceived confidence and personal values. The empirical research builds on a survey with a sample of 456 young adults using a questionnaire and showing an advertisement for hypothetical sustainable dairy products. Stepwise multiple regression models showed that 50\% of the variance in intention to consume sustainable dairy was explained by the combination of personal attitudes, perceived social influences, perceived consumer effectiveness and perceived availability. In addition, different levels of confidence and value orientation yield different strengths of the determinants. The findings yield public policy and marketing recommendations for stimulating sustainable food consumption among young adults.},

We demonstrate how straightforward it can be to write efficient code and implement techniques such as profiling or parallel computing. We supply a newly developed R package (aprof) that helps to identify computational bottlenecks in R code and determine whether optimization can be effective. Our review is complemented by a practical set of examples and detailed Supporting Information material (S1\textendash S3 Texts) that demonstrate large improvements in computational speed (ranging from 10.5 times to 14,000 times faster). By improving computational efficiency, biologists can feasibly solve more complex tasks, ask more ambitious questions, and include more sophisticated analyses in their research.},

A spring and/or summer peak has been the most frequent finding, correlating to climatic variables, especially luminosity. There are, however, no South American studies on this association.Methods The charts of 269 manic patients admitted from 1996 to 2000 in a psychiatric hospital at Belo Horizonte, Brazil, were reviewed. Seasonality was assessed with Cosinor Analysis. Correlations of the rate of admissions for mania to climatic variables were performed, including lagged and differenced data.Results A circannual pattern was evident, with a late winter-spring peak and a late summer-autumn trough. The rate of admissions for mania correlated positively to: (a) average index and previous months' hours of sunshine, and (b) differenced mean temperature; and negatively to: (a) index and previous months' rainfall, (b) index months' relative humidity, and (c) previous months' duration of days and mean temperature. Altogether, climatic variables explained 23.7\% of the variance in the rate of admissions for mania.Limitations This was a retrospective study conducted in a single institution.Conclusions The fact that climatic variables are associated to the course of bipolar disorder even in subtropical regions indicate that this effect may be more subtle and extent than previously thought. Further exploration of the biological mechanisms of this association is necessary.},

Females had significantly higher EQ than males, who in turn scored higher on the SQ inventory. Gender explained 12\textendash 14\% of the variation. Males were strikingly overrepresented in the group defined by a high SQ/low EQ profile or by a large SQ \textendash{} EQ difference; females dominated among people with a low SQ/high EQ profile or by a large EQ \textendash{} SQ difference. Students majoring in the natural sciences had higher SQs than psychology majors, but in both groups the gender difference in SQ and EQ was strong. For each participant a weighted composite score was generated by multivariate processing of the EQ and SQ data (Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis). These scores were associated in a sex-linked fashion to a biometric measure reflecting prenatal testosterone exposure, i.e. the ratio between index (2D)- and ring (4D) finger lengths. In males a high (female-typical) 2D:4D ratio predicted an enhanced tendency to empathize and a reduced tendency to systemize; in women, by contrast, the 2D:4D ratio was unrelated to these traits. The present research confirms earlier work of a gender difference in EQ and SQ. The difference appears robust as it appears as large in Sweden (a country with high cultural gender-equality) as in countries with considerably lower gender-equality.},

More recent evidence suggests that this peak may be associated with the increase in the duration of sunshine in spring. We investigated the effect of number of sunshine hours per month on suicide rates in Austria between 1996 and 2006.  Methods  Suicide data, differentiated by month of suicide, sex, and method of suicide (violent vs nonviolent methods), were provided by Statistics Austria. Data on the average number of sunshine hours per month were calculated from 39 representative meteorological stations (provided by the Austrian Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics). For statistical analysis, analysis of variance tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Pearson correlation tests were used.  Results  A total of 16\hspace{0.25em}673 suicides with a median of 126 {$\pm$} 19.8 suicides per month occurred in the examined period. A clear seasonal pattern was observed, with suicide frequencies being highest between March and May and lowest between November and January (df = 11, F = 5.2, P \&lt; .0001) for men (df = 11, F = 4.9, P \&lt; .0001) and women (df = 11, F = 2.4, P = .008). The average number of sunshine hours per month was significantly correlated with the number of suicides among both sexes (r = .43, P \&lt; .0001), violent methods (r = .48, P \&lt; .0001) but not with nonviolent methods (r = .03, P = .707).  Conclusions  This study shows that seasonal changes in sunshine account for variations in the number of suicides and especially violent suicides. We propose that sunshine, via interactions with serotonin neurotransmission, may trigger increased impulsivity and promote suicidal acts. However, because of the hypothesis-generating design of this study, more research is needed to further clarify the role of sunshine in triggering neurobiologic changes, which might contribute to suicidal behavior.},

  abstract = {The veracity of substantive research claims hinges on the way experimental data are collected and analyzed. In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology's academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result\textemdash a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label ``confirmatory,'' and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled ``exploratory.'' We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception.},

This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage\textendash Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility.},

For example, Strack, Martin, and Stepper (1988) instructed participants to rate the funniness of cartoons using a pen that they held in their mouth. In line with the facial feedback hypothesis, when participants held the pen with their teeth (inducing a ``smile''), they rated the cartoons as funnier than when they held the pen with their lips (inducing a ``pout''). This seminal study of the facial feedback hypothesis has not been replicated directly. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 17 independent direct replications of Study 1 from Strack et al. (1988), all of which followed the same vetted protocol. A meta-analysis of these studies examined the difference in funniness ratings between the ``smile'' and ``pout'' conditions. The original Strack et al. (1988) study reported a rating difference of 0.82 units on a 10-point Likert scale. Our meta-analysis revealed a rating difference of 0.03 units with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from -0.11 to 0.16.},

The WAT was designed to reduce the degree of successful guessing relative to the WGCTA by increasing the number of response alternatives (i.e., 80\% of WGCTA items are 2-alternative, multiple-choice), a change that was hypothesized to result in more desirable test information and standard-error functions. Analyses using the 3-parameter logistic item response theory (IRT) model in a sample of undergraduates (N = 407) supported this prediction, even when the WAT item pool was shortened to match the length of the WGCTA. Convergent validity between full-pool IRT score estimates was r = .69. Implications for subsequent research on IRT-based measurement of critical thinking are discussed.

The present study tested n = 1761 students with these instruments, to determine if short versions of these scales could be constructed. This would be desirable both for faster assessment and to establish which are the key items on each scale. Principal component analysis and factor analysis suggested that a 22-item version of the EQ (EQ-Short) and a 25-item version of the SQ (SQ-Short) were highly correlated with the full scale versions. The reliability of each short scale was reasonable. Results showed that females scored significantly higher than males on the EQ-Short, whilst males scored higher than females on the SQ-Short. Additionally, scores were analyzed according to the degree the student was studying. On the EQ-Short, students studying humanities scored higher than students studying sciences, whereas on the SQ-Short, the results were the opposite. Finally, distributions of the population who showed `brain types' based on the scores on two scales were examined. The pattern of distribution of the brain types was consistent with the E\textendash S theory. These results suggest that the EQ-Short and SQ-Short are useful instruments for measuring fundamental cognitive styles.},

  abstract = {l-Glutamic acid and its ammonium, calcium, monosodium and potassium salts were evaluated by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1988. The Committee noted that intestinal and hepatic metabolism results in elevation of levels in systemic circulation only after extremely high doses given by gavage ({$>$}30mg/kg body weight). Ingestion of monosodium glutamate (MSG) was not associated with elevated levels in maternal milk, and glutamate did not readily pass the placental barrier. Human infants metabolized glutamate similarly to adults. Conventional toxicity studies using dietary administration of MSG in several species did not reveal any specific toxic or carcinogenic effects nor were there any adverse outcomes in reproduction and teratology studies. Attention was paid to central nervous system lesions produced in several species after parenteral administration of MSG or as a consequence of very high doses by gavage. Comparative studies indicated that the neonatal mouse was most sensitive to neuronal injury; older animals and other species (including primates) were less so. Blood levels of glutamate associated with lesions of the hypothalamus in the neonatal mouse were not approached in humans even after bolus doses of 10 g MSG in drinking water. Because human studies failed to confirm an involvement of MSG in ``Chinese Restaurant Syndrome'' or other idiosyncratic intolerance, the JECFA allocated an ``acceptable daily intake (ADI) not specified'' to glutamic acid and its salts. No additional risk to infants was indicated. The Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) of the European Commission reached a similar evaluation in 1991. The conclusions of a subsequent review by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) did not discount the existence of a sensitive subpopulation but otherwise concurred with the safety evaluation of JECFA and the SCF.},

  abstract = {Election forecasts have traditionally been based on representative polls, in which randomly sampled individuals are asked who they intend to vote for. While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable costs of time and money. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical benefits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.},

Reliability estimates were higher using factor analysis (.88) than the correction for attenuation formula (.64), and they were higher using group-level data (.82) than individual-level data (.70).

  abstract = {\emph{Dry Bones Rattling} offers the first in-depth treatment of how to rebuild the social capital of America's communities while promoting racially inclusive, democratic participation. The Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) network in Texas and the Southwest is gaining national attention as a model for reviving democratic life in the inner city--and beyond. This richly drawn study shows how the IAF network works with religious congregations and other community-based institutions to cultivate the participation and leadership of Americans most left out of our elite-centered politics. Interfaith leaders from poor communities of color collaborate with those from more affluent communities to build organizations with the power to construct affordable housing, create job-training programs, improve schools, expand public services, and increase neighborhood safety. In clear and accessible prose, Mark Warren argues that the key to revitalizing democracy lies in connecting politics to community institutions and the values that sustain them. By doing so, the IAF network builds an organized, multiracial constituency with the power to advance desperately needed social policies. While Americans are most aware of the religious right, Warren documents the growth of progressive faith-based politics in America. He offers a realistic yet hopeful account of how this rising trend can transform the lives of people in our most troubled neighborhoods. Drawing upon six years of original fieldwork, \emph{Dry Bones Rattling} proposes new answers to the problems of American democracy, community life, race relations, and the urban crisis.},

Based upon a consideration of human social life and a functional design analysis of depression's core symptomatology we offer a comprehensive theory of its adaptive significance called the Social Navigation Hypothesis (SNH). The SNH attempts to account for all intensities of depression based on standard evolutionary theories of sociality, communication and psychological pain. The SNH suggests that depression evolved to perform two complimentary social problem-solving functions. First, depression induces cognitive changes that focus and enhance capacities for the accurate analysis and solution of key social problems, suggesting a social rumination function. Second, the costs associated with the anhedonia and psychomotor perturbation of depression can persuade reluctant social partners to provide help or make concessions via two possible mechanisms, namely, honest signaling and passive, unintentional fitness extortion. Thus it may also have a social motivation function.},

Data from each study were expressed in a uniform fashion, as plots of changes in the rate of subjective time (estimated from changes in timing behaviour) against changes in body temperature. In almost all cases, rate of subjective time increased when body temperature increased above normal, and decreased when body temperature was lowered below normal, although observations of the latter type were rare. The data also suggested a parametric effect of body temperature, with higher temperatures generally producing faster subjective time. Some possible mechanisms for the effects obtained were discussed, with the most promising explanation probably being that the temperature manipulation produces changes in arousal.},

We use a commonly applied ecological tool, rank-abundance curves (RACs), to evaluate the ecological response of benthic foraminiferal and ostracode communities to the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, which may be seen as an analog for current and future global warming. RACs are proxies for community structure, and therefore changes in the shape of RACs allow inferences to be drawn about and quantification of ecological responses. Benthic foraminiferal communities became increasingly stressed during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, and community reorganization occurred before the taxonomically defined extinction horizon. In contrast, ostracode communities became less stressed during the same interval, reinforcing the idea that different groups of organisms respond differently to extinction events and global warming. The decoupling of ecologic impact from taxonomic impact during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum reaffirms the fact that future climate change could have far-reaching effects on taxa and ecosystems and proves the importance of examining both the taxonomic and ecologic responses of communities during extinction events.},

Behavioral decision research over the last 30 years provides a series of lessons about the importance of affect in perceptions of risk and in decisions to take actions that reduce or manage perceived risks. Evidence from a range of domains suggests that worry drives risk management decisions. When people fail to be alarmed about a risk or hazard, they do not take precautions. Recent personal experience strongly influences the evaluation of a risky option. Low-probability events generate less concern than their probability warrants on average, but more concern than they deserve in those rare instances when they do occur. Personal experience with noticeable and serious consequences of global warming is still rare in many regions of the world. When people base their decisions on statistical descriptions about a hazard provided by others, characteristics of the hazard identified as psychological risk dimensions predict differences in alarm or worry across different classes of risk. The time-delayed, abstract, and often statistical nature of the risks of global warming does not evoke strong visceral reactions. These results suggest that we should find ways to evoke visceral reactions towards the risk of global warming, perhaps by simulations of its concrete future consequences for people's home or other regions they visit or value. Increased concern about global warming needs to solicited carefully, however, to prevent a decrease in concern about other relevant risks. The generation of worry or concern about global warming may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for desirable or appropriate protective or mitigating behavior on part of the general public.},

Whereas previously these models were proposed separately as different cases, our framework unifies these models and enables one to study them simultaneously.

To examine this theory, we recorded feedback-related negativity (FRN) toward others' large or small gains or losses in a stock market context. We adopted the framework of social distance, according to which we hypothesized that because others in the stock market are far away, unidentified, and indistinct, people would show less sympathy or even schadenfreude toward others' large losses. The results indicated that FRN at Fz was significantly less negative when observing larger decreases in others' stock, indicating that others' large losses are not unexpected negative events in the stock market and suggesting the existence of schadenfreude. Our research contributes to the understanding of social neurofinance by demonstrating the schadenfreude effect in relation to the stock market. This study also provides new information regarding the relationship between FRN and the social emotions that form the expectations of gain and loss.},

Methods. Two previously described prediction models were adapted to compare expected and observed heat-related morbidity and mortality in 1999 based on the city's 1995 experience. Results. Both models showed that heat-related deaths and EMS runs in 1999 were at least 49\% lower than levels predicted by the 1995 relation between heat and heat-related deaths or EMS runs. Conclusions. Reductions in heat-related morbidity and mortality in 1999 were not attributable to differences in heat levels alone. Changes in public health preparedness and response may also have contributed to these reductions.},

Such fattened tails have strong implications for situations, like climate change, where a catastrophe is theoretically possible because prior knowledge cannot place sufficiently narrow bounds on overall damages. This paper shows that the economic consequences of fat-tailed structural uncertainty (along with unsureness about high-temperature damages) can readily outweigh the effects of discounting in climate-change policy analysis.},

METHODS: Parasuicide was defined as suicide attempts and deliberate self-harm inflicted with no intent to die. Articles in English on rates of parasuicide in the general population from 1970 through June 2000 were identified by keyword searches of the PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases. Studies that provided data from a representative population sample and provided incidence or prevalence rates were included in the review. Articles focusing on subsamples such as adolescents or psychiatric patients were excluded. Results and conclusions: Twenty studies were analyzed. Although methodological problems constitute a major limitation in interpretation of the results, the literature indicates that parasuicide is a serious public health problem. Reported annual rates of parasuicide in recent decades range from 2.6 to 1,100 per 100,000, and lifetime prevalence rates range from 720 to 5,930 per 100,000. The most important risk factors identified were younger age and female gender. Others included being single or divorced, being unemployed, having a recent change in living situation, having a mental disorder, and having a previous parasuicide incident.},

Bias turns out to be relatively easy to recognize in the behaviors of others, but often difficult to detect in one's own judgments. Most previous research on the bias blind spot has focused on bias in the social domain. In 2 studies, we found replicable bias blind spots with respect to many of the classic cognitive biases studied in the heuristics and biases literature (e.g., Tversky \& Kahneman, 1974). Further, we found that none of these bias blind spots were attenuated by measures of cognitive sophistication such as cognitive ability or thinking dispositions related to bias. If anything, a larger bias blind spot was associated with higher cognitive ability. Additional analyses indicated that being free of the bias blind spot does not help a person avoid the actual classic cognitive biases. We discuss these findings in terms of a generic dual-process theory of cognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).},

Employment and economic uncertainty, chronic stress, anxiety, and social isolation are likely to have negative impacts on parent mental health, couple and family relationships, as well as child health and development. Objective: This study aims to: (1) provide timely information on the mental health impacts of the emerging COVID-19 crisis in a close to representative sample of Australian parents and children (0-18 years); (2) identify adults and families most at risk of poor mental health outcomes; and, (3) identify factors to target through clinical and public health intervention to reduce risk. Specifically, this study will investigate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased risk for parents' mental health, lower wellbeing, loneliness, and alcohol use; parent-parent and parent-child relationships (both verbal and physical); and child and adolescent mental health problems. Methods: The study aims to recruit a close to representative sample of at least 2,000 adults aged 18 years and over living in Australia who are parents of a child 0-4 years (early childhood, N=400); 5-12 years (primary school N=800); and 13-18 years (secondary school, N=800). The design will be a longitudinal cohort study using an online recruitment methodology. Participants will be invited to complete an online baseline self-report survey (20 minutes) followed by a series of shorter online surveys (10 minutes) scheduled every two weeks for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., estimated to be 14 surveys over 6 months). Results: The study will employ post stratification weights to address differences between the final sample and the national population in geographic communities across Australia. Associations will be analyzed using multilevel modeling with time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over the testing period. Conclusions: This study will provide timely information on the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on parents and children in Australia; identify communities, parents, families, and children most at risk of poor outcomes; and, identify potential factors to address in clinical and public health interventions to reduce risk.},

  abstract = {Background:  Empathizing is a specific component of social cognition. Empathizing is also specifically impaired in autism spectrum condition (ASC). These are two dimensions, measurable using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). ASC also involves strong systemizing, a dimension measured using the Systemizing Quotient (SQ). The present study examined the relationship between the EQ, AQ and SQ. The EQ and SQ have been used previously to test for sex differences in 5 `brain types' (Types S, E, B and extremes of Type S or E). Finally, people with ASC have been conceptualized as an extreme of the male brain.  Method:  We revised the SQ to avoid a traditionalist bias, thus producing the SQ-Revised (SQ-R). AQ and EQ were not modified. All 3 were administered online. Sample:Students (723 males, 1038 females) were compared to a group of adults with ASC group (69 males, 56 females). Aims: (1) To report scores from the SQ-R. (2) To test for SQ-R differences among students in the sciences vs. humanities. (3) To test if AQ can be predicted from EQ and SQ-R scores. (4) To test for sex differences on each of these in a typical sample, and for the absence of a sex difference in a sample with ASC if both males and females with ASC are hyper-masculinized. (5) To report percentages of males, females and people with an ASC who show each brain type. Results: AQ score was successfully predicted from EQ and SQ-R scores. In the typical group, males scored significantly higher than females on the AQ and SQ-R, and lower on the EQ. The ASC group scored higher than sex-matched controls on the SQ-R, and showed no sex differences on any of the 3 measures. More than twice as many typical males as females were Type S, and more than twice as many typical females as males were Type E. The majority of adults with ASC were Extreme Type S, compared to 5\% of typical males and 0.9\% of typical females. The EQ had a weak negative correlation with the SQ-R. Discussion:Empathizing is largely but not completely independent of systemizing. The weak but significant negative correlation may indicate a trade-off between them. ASC involves impaired empathizing alongside intact or superior systemizing. Future work should investigate the biological basis of these dimensions, and the small trade-off between them.},

Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the modified statistics perform acceptably well even for n = 35.

Exploratory factor analyses identified four distinct personality facets associated with impulsive-like behavior which were labeled urgency, (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, and sensation seeking. Each of these traits was marked by a different facet of the FFM. Following the initial factor identification, scales to measure each of the personality facets were created and combined to form the UPPS Impulsive Behavior scale. Implications for the understanding of impulsive behavior and the FFM are discussed, as are future applications of the UPPS impulsive behavior scale.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

During the most intense heat (July 14 through 20), there were 485 heat-related deaths and 739 excess deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The methods used here provide insight into the great impact of the Chicago heat wave on selected populations, but the lack of methodological standards makes comparisons across geographical areas problematic.},

Popular and academic debate often assumes this is due to ignorance or misunderstanding on the part of the public, but some studies have suggested political beliefs and values may play a more important role in determining belief versus scepticism about climate change. The current research used two representative postal surveys of the UK public to: measure scepticism and uncertainty about climate change; determine how scepticism varies according to individual characteristics, knowledge and values; and examine how scepticism has changed over time. Findings show denial of climate change is less common than the perception that the issue has been exaggerated. Scepticism was found to be strongly determined by individuals' environmental and political values (and indirectly by age, gender, location and lifestyle) rather than by education or knowledge. Between 2003 and 2008, public uncertainty about climate change has remained remarkably constant, although belief that claims about the issue are exaggerated has doubled over that period. These results are interpreted with reference to psychological concepts of motivated reasoning, confirmation bias and `finite pool of worry'. Implications for communication and policy are discussed.},

  abstract = {1.  The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57\% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2.  The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3.  We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4~years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4.  An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

In this paper, the authors systematically review published empirical data on the performance of Africans on the following IQ tests: Draw-A-Man (DAM) test, Kaufman-Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC), the Wechsler scales (WAIS \&amp; WISC), and several other IQ tests (but not the Raven's tests). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are explicitly discussed. Results show that average IQ of Africans on these tests is approximately 82 when compared to UK norms. We provide estimates of the average IQ per country and estimates on the basis of alternative inclusion criteria. Our estimate of average IQ converges with the finding that national IQs of sub-Saharan African countries as predicted from several international studies of student achievement are around 82. It is suggested that this estimate should be considered in light of the Flynn Effect. It is concluded that more psychometric studies are needed to address the issue of measurement bias of western IQ tests for Africans.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Several fraud cases, widespread failure to replicate or reproduce seminal findings, and pervasive error in the scientific literature have led to a crisis of confidence in the biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences. In this review, the author discusses some of the core findings that point at weak spots in contemporary science and considers the human factors that underlie them. He delves into the human tendencies that create errors and biases in data collection, analyses, and reporting of research results. He presents several solutions to deal with observer bias, publication bias, the researcher's tendency to exploit degrees of freedom in their analysis of data, low statistical power, and errors in the reporting of results, with a focus on the specific challenges in animal welfare research. Abstract In this review, the author discusses several of the weak spots in contemporary science, including scientific misconduct, the problems of post hoc hypothesizing (HARKing), outcome switching, theoretical bloopers in formulating research questions and hypotheses, selective reading of the literature, selective citing of previous results, improper blinding and other design failures, p-hacking or researchers' tendency to analyze data in many different ways to find positive (typically significant) results, errors and biases in the reporting of results, and publication bias. The author presents some empirical results highlighting problems that lower the trustworthiness of reported results in scientific literatures, including that of animal welfare studies. Some of the underlying causes of these biases are discussed based on the notion that researchers are only human and hence are not immune to confirmation bias, hindsight bias, and minor ethical transgressions. The author discusses solutions in the form of enhanced transparency, sharing of data and materials, (post-publication) peer review, pre-registration, registered reports, improved training, reporting guidelines, replication, dealing with publication bias, alternative inferential techniques, power, and other statistical tools.},

However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically. Methods and Findings We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance. Conclusions Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.},

First, six different ways of approaching explanatory claims are briefly described and found, in part, to be unsatisfactory. It is argued that they should be supplemented by an analysis of underlying and sometimes partly unacknowledged causal presuppositions. This approach could be termed a causal analytical investigation, and in order to demonstrate its potential, it is applied to a concrete example: research into dental anxiety. The analysis shows that seemingly competing or complementary explanatory claims here neither compete with nor complement each other; instead, the analysis demonstrates that they explain different things. We then broaden the picture by discussing the relationship between aetiology and treatment. Finally we argue in favour of the general applicability of the approach and its relevance to science in general and to science-based practice.},

Method: Studies presenting data on alcohol and drug use disorders and suicide originally identified by Harris and Barraclough were used in this study. To find additional studies, (1) the location of English language reports on MEDLINE (1994\textendash 2002) were identified with the search terms `substance-disorders' with `mortality' and `follow-up', (2) read throughs were conducted of four prominent alcohol and drug specialty journals from 1966 through 2002, and (3) the reference sections of studies that met criteria were searched for additional reports. This strategy yielded 42 new studies meeting eligibility criteria. Results: The estimated standardized mortality ratios (SMR; 95\% confidence interval) for suicide were as follows: alcohol use disorder (979; 95\% CI 898\textendash 1065; p \&lt; 0.001), opioid use disorder (1351; 95\% CI 1047\textendash 1715; p \&lt; 0.001), intravenous drug use (1373; 95\% CI 1029\textendash 1796; p \&lt; 0.001), mixed drug use (1685; 95\% CI 1473\textendash 1920; p \&lt; 0.001), heavy drinking (351; 95\% CI 251\textendash 478; p \&lt; 0.001). SMR estimates stratified by sex were also calculated. Conclusions: Additional studies on the association of suicide and mixed drug use, heavy drinking, and alcohol use disorders in women augmented the findings of Harris and Barraclough, along with a novel estimate for intravenous drug use, a byproduct of intensive research on HIV in the past decade. There is a large empirical literature on alcohol use disorders and suicide and a moderate literature on suicide and opioid use disorders and IV drug use. There remains limited prospective data on the association of suicide and other drug use disorders (e.g., cocaine, cannabis).},

We found that there was an influence of self-esteem contingency for controllable but not for uncontrollable regret types. For controllable regret types individuals with a high contingent (i.e., unstable) self-esteem reported greater regret intensity than those with a low contingent (i.e., stable) self-esteem.

  abstract = {Many researchers are aware that null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) have significant problems. One alternative strategy for simple research questions is the use of Bayes Factor null hypothesis tests. I will argue that while Bayes Factor null hypothesis tests are an improvement over NHST, they are unsuitable as a default analytic strategy in the social sciences. Specifically, Bayes Factor null hypothesis tests are only useful for producing conclusions about the posterior probability of hypotheses if our prior knowledge takes a very specific form: a ``spike and slab'' distribution, with a substantial (ideally 50\%) probability that the parameter is exactly zero, and the rest of the prior density spread over a wide range of values. Such a prior is both highly informative and also rather unlikely to be a reasonable representation of the actual prior knowledge held about a particular effect or relationship in the social sciences. I argue that we need to stop worrying about testing the null hypothesis, which is almost always false. Instead, Bayesian estimation is a more useful default analytic strategy\textemdash perhaps with a particular focus on the probability that a particular parameter is positive or negative. However, to allow Bayesian estimation to become widely used by everyday researchers, we as methodologists need to produce sensible informative default priors, and implement them in easy-to-use software. I will produce some suggestions for how this might be accomplished.},

Furthermore, Seo found that this relationship was completely mediated by self-efficacy. Seo's study has been influential in the literature but has not been independently replicated.

  abstract = {The earth is currently facing a climate change crisis caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Conservation psychology has the capacity to produce research that can inform efforts to modify human behavior to mitigate climate change. However, psychology has been facing a crisis of its own: A replication crisis. Several recent studies have found that the findings of many published psychological studies cannot be reproduced in independent replications. In response to this crisis, psychologists have begun to pursue practices that can improve the replicability and credibility of findings\textemdash for example, preregistering data collection and analysis plans before collecting data, and openly sharing data for re-analysis. However, open science practices such as these are not yet widely employed in conservation psychology. We argue that replicability is especially important in conservation psychology given the field's focus on high stakes applied research. In addition, we provide an example of a preregistered replication (of van der Linden et al. 2017). van der Linden et al. reported that they were able to successfully ``inoculate'' participants against politically motivated misinformation about climate change by pre-emptively warning them of this misinformation. In our replication study, we preregistered hypotheses based on van der Linden et al's study, along with a detailed data collection and analysis plan (available at https://osf.io/8ymj6/). Our replication study used a mixed between-within design, with data collected via Mechanical Turk (N = 792). We were able to replicate some (but not all) of van der Linden et al's findings. Specifically, we found that providing information about the scientific consensus on climate change increased perceptions of scientific consensus, as did an inoculation intervention provided prior to provision of misinformation. However, we were unable to replicate their finding that an inoculation intervention counteracted the effect of misinformation to a greater extent than simply providing information about scientific consensus.},

  abstract = {Most researchers and students in the social sciences learn of S. S. Stevens' classic taxonomy of four ``scales'' of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio). Many are exposed to the idea that conducting ``parametric'' analyses with ordinal or nominal variables is inadmissible, but are left confused about the actual basis for this rule (and why it is roundly ignored in practice). This is reflective of an unusual situation: Despite many researchers being aware of a rule proscribing particular forms of analysis with particular scales of measurement, the basis for this rule comes from a theory of measurement (representationalism) which is rarely discussed outside of the relatively esoteric body of literature concerned with measurement theory. Consequently, many struggle to achieve a satisfactory understanding of the basis for the rule. In this article, I attempt to provide an accessible and non-technical explanation of why the representational theory of measurement (arguably) implies that certain types of analyses are inappropriate with particular scales of measurement. I go on to describe alternative theories of measurement (operationalism, the classical theory of measurement, and latent variable theory), and suggest that latent variable theory more closely converges with how most contemporary researchers think about measurement than does representationalism. Furthermore, I explain how the measurement concerns that provoked Stevens' claims about inadmissibility are quite distinct from the statistical assumptions underlying data analyses\textemdash although there is an important connection between the two. I conclude by suggesting that researchers may find it more useful to critically examine their basis for assuming that particular attributes are quantitative and that particular relationships are linear rather than limiting themselves to the set of analyses that Stevens believed to be admissible with data of a given scale of measurement.},

Online social media and associated social networks are an increasingly important forum for public debate and are known to influence individual attitudes and behaviours \textendash{} yet online discussions and social networks related to climate change are not well understood. Here we construct several forms of social network for users communicating about climate change on the popular microblogging platform Twitter. We classify user attitudes to climate change based on message content and find that social networks are characterised by strong attitude-based homophily and segregation into polarised ``sceptic'' and ``activist'' groups. Most users interact only with like-minded others, in communities dominated by a single view. However, we also find mixed-attitude communities in which sceptics and activists frequently interact. Messages between like-minded users typically carry positive sentiment, while messages between sceptics and activists carry negative sentiment. We identify a number of general patterns in user behaviours relating to engagement with alternative views. Users who express negative sentiment are themselves the target of negativity. Users in mixed-attitude communities are less likely to hold a strongly polarised view, but more likely to express negative sentiment towards other users with differing views. Overall, social media discussions of climate change often occur within polarising ``echo chambers'', but also within ``open forums'', mixed-attitude communities that reduce polarisation and stimulate debate. Our results have implications for public engagement with this important global challenge.},

Aim: To compare the effects of several key theoretical variables on regret intensity: The time since the regretted event, whether the regret was one of action or inaction, the level of justification felt, and whether or not the regretted decision violated the participant's personal life rules. Method: A postal survey of 429 New Zealand adults. Conclusions: Contradicting folk wisdom and previous research, action regrets were felt more intensely than inaction regrets. The passing of time led to action regrets being felt even more intensely (in comparison to regrets of inaction), falsifying a prediction of the temporal theory of regret. The strongest predictor of regret intensity was the domain of regret: Regrets in intimate domains were felt more intensely than regrets in non-intimate domains.},

  abstract = {A strong consensus exists amongst climate scientists that the Earth is warming, and that this warming is due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Members of the public are nevertheless frequently exposed to misinformation about climate change (and the degree of scientific consensus on climate change). One strategy to combat such misinformation is attitudinal ``inoculation''\textemdash exposing individuals to a weakened item of misinformation along with a pre-emptive refutation. Van der Linden, Leiserowitz, Rosenthal, and Maibach (2017) reported that exposing participants to misinformation reduced the extent to which the participants perceived there to be a scientific consensus about climate change, but that the effect of this misinformation was successfully countered by an attitudinal inoculation. In this study, we report a preregistered replication of van der Linden et al. (2017). Our replication study used a mixed between-within design, with data collected via Mechanical Turk (N~=~792). We were able to replicate some (but not all) of van der Linden et al.'s findings. Specifically, we found that providing information about the scientific consensus on climate change increased perceptions of scientific consensus, as did an inoculation provided prior to provision of misinformation. However, we were unable to replicate their finding that an inoculation counteracted the effect of misinformation to a greater extent than simply providing information about scientific consensus\textemdash although this may have been due to a ceiling effect in our study.

This has led some authors to suggest that anthropogenic climate change may result in an increase in violent crime rates. In this study, we report an investigation of the relationship between temperature and assault incidence in New Zealand. Both police data listing recorded assaults as well as data from the Ministry of Health listing hospitalisations due to assault were examined. Geographical, seasonal, and irregular daily variation in temperature were all positively related to the incidence of assault, although only the effect of irregular variation in temperature was robust to controls for plausible confounds. The estimated effect of irregular daily variation in temperature was approximately 1.5 \% extra recorded assaults for each 1 \textdegree C increase in temperature. It remains difficult, however, to make accurate predictions about future assault rates in a warming world. For example, humans may react to sustained changes in climate in ways that differ markedly from their reaction to short-term variation in temperature. Climate change may also affect rates of violence via mechanisms other than those that currently drive the relationship between temperature and violence. Furthermore, assault rates may continue to change in response to factors unrelated to climate change, such as those responsible for the long-term historical decline in human violence.},

  abstract = {Self-control theory of crime has had considerable impact on mainstream criminology since it was first published in 1990 by Gottfredson and Hirschi. It is regarded as the most parsimonious criminological theory currently available and has been empirically tested across diverse populations and behaviours. Considerable empirical evidence supports the generality of self-control in predicting crime and analogous behaviours, with low self-control ranked as one of the strongest risk factors for crime. Of substantive concern however is a lack of explanatory power in the theory, a problem that besets criminological theorising in general. This study attempted to integrate self-control theory with theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Whilst self-control provides a stable-dispositional explanation for propensity to crime, TPB is interested in the decision-making processes related to involvement in crime. As such, the study examined the relationship between time-stable self-control and the mediating role of situational-specific factors in the causation of crime. The purpose of the study is twofold. Firstly to investigate the underlying mechanism by which a person with low self-control may have greater propensity to crime and secondly to increase the explanatory value of self-control theory. Three disparate groups were used to explore the single theories and the integrated theory; female students, male students, and prison inmates. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were conducted to examine the sufficiency of the theories to explain intention to commit crime across three groups. Low self-control was unable to explain behavioural intentions for students but was successful in explaining intentions to do crime in a prison population. The motivational elements of TPB, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control, were shown to exert considerable influence on intention to do crime across the three samples but not attitude. The integrated theory increased the explanatory value of self-control theory for prison inmates over and above its constituent theories. These findings were not replicated with male and female students, raising questions about the generality of self-control theory. Implications for self-control theory are discussed, especially the need to include significant others and behavioural control variables in understanding the causes of crime},

A Bayes factor indicates the degree to which data observed should increase (or decrease) the credibility of one hypothesis in comparison to another. Bayes factor analyses can be used to compare many types of models but are particularly helpful when comparing a point null hypothesis to a directional or nondirectional alternative hypothesis. A key advantage of this approach is that a Bayes factor analysis makes it clear when a set of observed data is more consistent with the null hypothesis than the alternative. Bayes factor alternatives to common tests used by developmental psychologists are available in easy-to-use software. However, we note that analysis using Bayes factors is a less general approach than Bayesian estimation/modeling, and is not the right tool for every research question.},

Some previous studies have found a positive relationship between temperature and suicide rates, suggesting that one potential impact may be an increase in suicide rates. In this study we report an investigation of temperature and suicide in New Zealand over the period 1988\textendash 2007. Days that were hotter than average for a particular location and time of year were associated with higher suicide rates (estimated effect: 1.8\% increase per \textdegree C). Paradoxically, warmer geographical locations were associated with lower suicide rates when controlling for demographic differences. This intriguing conflict between the effects of temporal and geographical variation in temperature echoes the findings of several prior studies. The possibility that the effect of warmer temperatures may vary depending on the time of exposure makes it difficult to predict how suicide rates will change in a warming world.}

Females were wounded about as often during the mating season as during the birth season, and more died during the birth season than during the mating season, although not significantly so.

However, mortality among the reproductively mature males was greater than among mature females. It was suggested that differential injury and mortality rates among adult males might be an indirect result of high levels of androgens which could conceivably alter threshold levels for stimuli initiating severe aggressive interactions.},

Principal-components analysis was then performed on the 1st-order interitem partial correlation matrix, controlling for ARS score. Evidence is presented that this procedure reduces the average interitem correlation among like-worded items, increases the average interitem correlation among differently worded items measuring the same concept, and produces a principal components solution that is more interpretable.

Although sampling weights must generally be used to derive unbiased estimates of univariate population characteristics, the decision about their use in regression analysis is more complicated. Where sampling weights are solely a function of independent variables included in the model, unweighted OLS estimates are preferred because they are unbiased, consistent, and have smaller standard errors than weighted OLS estimates. Where sampling weights are a function of the dependent variable (and thus of the error term), we recommend first attempting to respecify the model so that they are solely a function of the independent variables. If this can be accomplished, then unweighted OLS is again preferred. If the model cannot be respecified, then estimation of the model using sampling weights may be appropriate. In this case, however, the formula used by most computer programs for calculating standard errors will be incorrect. We recommend using the White heteroskedastic consistent estimator for the standard errors.},

Simulations were conducted to investigate factor recovery by PAF and MLFA for distortions of ideal simple structure and sample sizes between 25 and 5000. Results showed that PAF is preferred for population solutions with few indicators per factor and for overextraction. MLFA outperformed PAF in cases of unequal loadings within factors and for underextraction. It was further shown that PAF and MLFA do not always converge with increasing sample size. The simulation findings were confirmed by an empirical study as well as by a classic plasmode, Thurstone's box problem. The present results are of practical value for factor analysts.},

Specifically, the time until a beneficial outcome can be received is viewed as a cost and is weighed against the benefits of the outcome. We propose that impulsive individuals experience time differently, that is with a higher cost. Impulsive subjects, therefore, overestimate the duration of time intervals and, as a consequence, discount the value of delayed rewards more strongly than do self-controlled individuals. The literature on time perception and impulsivity, however, is not clear cut and needs a better theoretical foundation. Here, we develop the theoretical background on concepts of time perception, which could lead to an empirically based notion of the association between an altered sense of time and impulsivity.},

Strong social networks have been said to support individuals and collective initiatives of adaptation and enhance resilience. As a result, there is an expectation that social capital could reduce vulnerability to risks from the impacts of climate change in the health sector. This paper examines evidence on the role social networks play in individuals' responses to heat wave risk in a case study in the UK. Based on interviews with independently living elderly people and their primary social contacts in London and Norwich, we suggest that strong bonding networks could potentially exacerbate rather than reduce the vulnerability of elderly people to the effects of heat waves. Most respondents interviewed did not feel that heat waves posed a significant risk to them personally, and most said that they would be able to cope with hot weather. Bonding networks could perpetuate rather than challenge these narratives and therefore contribute to vulnerability rather than ameliorating it. These results suggest a complex rather than uniformly positive relationship between social capital, health and adaptation to climate change.},

With the high suicide rate and the abundance of social media data in South Korea, we have studied the potential of this new medium for predicting completed suicide at the population level. We tested two social media variables (suicide-related and dysphoria-related weblog entries) along with classical social, economic and meteorological variables as predictors of suicide over 3 years (2008 through 2010). Both social media variables were powerfully associated with suicide frequency. The suicide variable displayed high variability and was reactive to celebrity suicide events, while the dysphoria variable showed longer secular trends, with lower variability. We interpret these as reflections of social affect and social mood, respectively. In the final multivariate model, the two social media variables, especially the dysphoria variable, displaced two classical economic predictors \textendash{} consumer price index and unemployment rate. The prediction model developed with the 2-year training data set (2008 through 2009) was validated in the data for 2010 and was robust in a sensitivity analysis controlling for celebrity suicide effects. These results indicate that social media data may be of value in national suicide forecasting and prevention.},

In Study 2 (n = 102), the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead when U.S. special forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still alive. Hierarchical regression models showed that mutually incompatible conspiracy theories are positively associated because both are associated with the view that the authorities are engaged in a cover-up (Study 2). The monological nature of conspiracy belief appears to be driven not by conspiracy theories directly supporting one another but by broader beliefs supporting conspiracy theories in general.},

Twenty years on, this thesis investigates whether Lykken's criticisms and conclusions are still valid via an exposition of three contentious issues in psychological science: the measurement problem, null hypothesis significance testing, and the granularity of research methods. Though finding that little progress has been made, Observation Oriented Modelling is advanced as a promising methodological solution for improving psychological research.},

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the elevation of this neurotrophin remain unknown. Here we show that FNDC5, a previously identified muscle protein that is induced in exercise and is cleaved and secreted as irisin, is also elevated by endurance exercise in the hippocampus of mice. Neuronal Fndc5 gene expression is regulated by PGC-1{$\alpha$}, and Pgc1a-/- mice show reduced Fndc5 expression in the brain. Forced expression of FNDC5 in primary cortical neurons increases Bdnf expression, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of FNDC5 reduces Bdnf.~Importantly, peripheral delivery of FNDC5 to the liver via adenoviral vectors, resulting in elevated blood irisin, induces expression of Bdnf and other neuroprotective genes in the hippocampus. Taken together, our findings link endurance exercise and the important metabolic mediators, PGC-1{$\alpha$} and FNDC5, with BDNF expression in the brain.},

The most common techniques used were permitting the child some degree of control over terminating treatment if difficulties were experienced, coaxing and reinforcing positive behaviours, and furnishing waiting areas with child-oriented play materials. Most respondents never used TV or video-tape distraction strategies, film or video-modelling tape or hypnosis. More than half of the respondents believed there was insufficient information available to them on current anxiety/behaviour management techniques. The use of particular management techniques varied by gender, age, university of graduation, State or Territory of residence, and membership of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Paediatric Dentistry. Patterns of use of particular techniques showed similarities and contrasts with other studies. Patterns of use in the national sample were almost identical to the frequency and pattern of use by Victorian dentists. In contrast, however, North American studies have reported a higher frequency of use of hand-over-mouth, and lower use of general anaesthesia within the armamentarium of techniques and strategies used by dentists to manage anxious or difficult children.},

Performance is reported to be better when body temperature is high/near its circadian peak and worse when body temperature is low/near its circadian minimum. We assessed whether this relationship between performance and body temperature reflects the regulation of both the internal biological timekeeping system and/or the influence of body temperature on performance independent of circadian phase. Fourteen subjects participated in a forced desynchrony protocol allowing assessment of the relationship between body temperature and performance while controlling for circadian phase and hours awake. Most neurobehavioral measures varied as a function of internal biological time and duration of wakefulness. A number of performance measures were better when body temperature was elevated, including working memory, subjective alertness, visual attention, and the slowest 10\% of reaction times. These findings demonstrate that an increased body temperature, associated with and independent of internal biological time, is correlated with improved performance and alertness. These results support the hypothesis that body temperature modulates neurobehavioral function in humans.},

  abstract = {Current anthropogenic climate change is the result of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere, which records the aggregation of billions of individual decisions. Here we consider a broad range of individual lifestyle choices and calculate their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, based on 148 scenarios from 39 sources. We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions per year), living car-free (2.4 tCO2e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 tCO2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic flight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e saved per year). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). Though adolescents poised to establish lifelong patterns are an important target group for promoting high-impact actions, we find that ten high school science textbooks from Canada largely fail to mention these actions (they account for 4\% of their recommended actions), instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential emissions reductions. Government resources on climate change from the EU, USA, Canada, and Australia also focus recommendations on lower-impact actions. We conclude that there are opportunities to improve existing educational and communication structures to promote the most effective emission-reduction strategies and close this mitigation gap.},

Removing the 2 anxiety-related items from the MHI-5 yields the MHI-3. We assessed the performance of the Japanese versions of the MHI-5 and MHI-3 in detecting depressive symptoms in the general population of Japan. Methods From the population of Japan, 4500 people 16 years old or older were selected by stratified-random sampling. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36, which includes the MHI-5) and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) were included in a self-administered questionnaire. ZSDS scores of 48 and above were taken to indicate the presence of moderate or severe depressive symptoms, and scores of 56 and above were taken to indicate the presence of severe depressive symptoms. We computed the correlation coefficient between the ZSDS score and the scores on the MHI-5 and MHI-3. We also computed the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Of the 3107 subjects (69\% of the 4500 initially selected), 14.0\% had moderate or severe depressive symptoms, and 2.0\% had severe depressive symptoms as measured with the ZSDS. The correlations of ZSDS scores with MHI-5 scores and with MHI-3 scores were similar: -0.63 and -0.61, respectively. These correlation coefficients were almost the same whether or not the data were stratified by age and sex. For detecting severe depressive symptoms with the MHI-5, the area under the ROC curve was 0.942 (95\%CI: 0.919 \textendash{} 0.965); for the MHI-3, it was 0.933 (95\%CI: 0.904 \textendash{} 0.962). Conclusion The MHI-5 and MHI-3 scores were correlated with the ZSDS score, and can be used to identify people with depressive symptoms in the general population of Japan.},

The paper relies on an extensive review of empirical literature published in English after 2009, as well as an analysis of unpublished market research data from member companies of Vaccines Europe. Our synthesis suggests that hesitant attitudes to vaccination are prevalent and may be increasing since the influenza pandemic of 2009. We define hesitancy as an expression of concern or doubt about the value or safety of vaccination. This means that hesitant attitudes are not confined only to those who refuse vaccination or those who encourage others to refuse vaccination. For many people, vaccination attitudes are shaped not just by healthcare professionals but also by an array of other information sources, including online and social media sources. We find that healthcare professionals report increasing challenges to building a trustful relationship with patients, through which they might otherwise allay concerns and reassure hesitant patients. We also find a range of reasons for vaccination attitudes, only some of which can be characterised as being related to lack of awareness or misinformation. Reasons that relate to issues of mistrust are cited more commonly in the literature than reasons that relate to information deficit. The importance of trust in the institutions involved with vaccination is discussed in terms of implications for researchers and policy-makers; we suggest that rebuilding this trust is a multi-stakeholder problem requiring a co-ordinated strategy.},

The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned\textemdash that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to consider the generalizability of one's conclusions from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

Objective The aim of this study was to compare the QoL and life satisfaction scores between people with physical disabilities who participated in adapted sports and those who did not participate in any adapted sports. Methods This cross-sectional controlled study included 60 individuals with physical disabilities (paraplegia and amputee). Participants were divided into two groups based on sports participation and non-sports participation. Group one included 30 disabled elite athletes who participated in adapted sports. The control group included 30 disabled individuals not involved in any adapted sports. We compared scores on the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Scale (WHOQoL-BREF) and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) between the two groups. Participation in the community and QoL was examined as a reflection of participant's priority on sports participation. Results We found that WHOQoL-BREF physical, psychological, and social domain scores were significantly higher in group one than in the control group (p~\&lt;~0.05), whereas environment domain scores were similar (p~=~0.13). Moreover, SWLS scores were significantly higher in group one than in the control group (p~\&lt;~0.05). Conclusions These results showed that people with physical disabilities who participated in adapted sports had significantly higher QoL and life satisfaction scores compared to people with physical disabilities not involved in any adapted sports.},

  abstract = {Background: Research shows that ability to get around (AGA) is significantly associated with perceived quality of life (PQOL) among older persons with self-reported visual impairment. Much of this impact, however, is through satisfaction with one's functional capacity. Satisfaction with functional capacity is a construct composed of five items: satisfaction with (1) activities of daily living, (2) capacity to work, (3) self, (4) health and (5) sleep. At present, it is not known how AGA interacts individually with these items to influence PQOL. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which AGA interacts with each of these five items to affect PQOL. Methods: Structural equation modelling was employed in a secondary-analysis of data from 356 persons (aged 56\textendash 72) with self-reported visual impairment to identify the pathways by which AGA affects PQOL. Results: Satisfaction with self and health were the only items found to be both directly related to QOL and to provide a significant pathway between AGA and PQOL. Conclusion: AGA significantly affects PQOL both directly and indirectly through its impact on people's satisfaction with self and health. Lessons may be learnt from this to better focus mobility interventions to enhance PQOL in this population.Implications for RehabilitationThe findings of this study indicate that ability to get around (AGA) has a significant impact on perceived quality of life (PQOL): the stated goal of many rehabilitation programs for older persons who are visually impaired.The study also found that the primary pathway by which AGA influenced PQOL was indirect through its association with both satisfaction with one's self and health rather than direct.Attempts to enhance PQOL by increasing AGA may be most effective if the focus of intervention was on restoring one's sense of self and health as opposed to focusing on meeting practical needs.},

Recent research has suggested that seasonal patterns of suicide deaths have diminished considerably. The seasonality pattern between attempts and completed ones are not the same. This paper is the first one to examine seasonal variation between suicide deaths and attempts simultaneously. Method: Census and Statistics Department and the Hospital Authority provided mortality and morbidity data on suicides for the period 1997-2001 in Hong Kong SAR, respectively. Seasonal patterns of suicide deaths and attempts were examined by a harmonic analysis and a non-parametric chi-square test. Results: A significant seasonal variation was detected in suicide attempts with a markedly bi-seasonal pattern was found amongst females with a peak in May and October; only a cyclic pattern was observed for males with a peak in summer. The female attempters who used non-violent suicide methods contributed to the second peak in October. On the other hand, there was no evidence of significant differences in the seasonal distribution among the suicide deaths for males and females. Only a mild pattern was found amongst females involving in violent suicide deaths, while others can be treated as a random event and no significantly pattern was observed in our study. Overall, a significant difference in seasonal variation existed between suicide deaths and attempts (p-value{$<$}0.01). Conclusions: This study reinforces the findings that seasonal variation in suicide appears to be diminishing. Also, suicide attempters and completed suicides in Hong Kong seem to arise from two non-identical but overlapping groups in the community.},

All of the test-retest kappa for axis II disorders, except for narcissistic personality disorder (1.0) and paranoid personality disorder (.39), were also found to be fair-good. Interrater and test-retest dimensional reliability figures for axis II were generally higher than those for their categorical counterparts; most were in the excellent range ({$>$} .75). In terms of axis I, excellent median interrater kappa were found for six of the 10 disorders diagnosed five times or more, whereas fair-good median interrater kappa were found for the other four axis I disorders. In general, test-retest reliability figures for axis I disorders were somewhat lower than the interrater reliability figures. Three test-retest kappa were in the excellent range, six were in the fair-good range, and one (for dysthymia) was in the poor range (.35). Taken together, the results of this study suggest that both axis I and axis II disorders can be diagnosed reliably when using appropriate semistructured interviews. They also suggest that the reliability of axis II disorders is roughly equivalent to that reliability found for most axis I disorders.},

Science, 103, 677680] states that measurement levels should guide the choice of statistical test, such that the truth value of statements based on a statistical analysis remains invariant under admissible transformations of the data. Lord [Lord, F. M. (1953). On the statistical treatment of football numbers. American Psychologist, 8, 750\textendash 751] challenged this theory. In a thought experiment, a parametric test is performed on football numbers (identifying players: a nominal representation) to decide whether a sample from the machine issuing these numbers should be considered non-random. This is an apparently illegal test, since its outcomes are not invariant under admissible transformations for the nominal measurement level. Nevertheless, it results in a sensible conclusion: the number-issuing machine was tampered with. In the ensuing measurement-statistics debate Lord's contribution has been influential, but has also led to much confusion. The present aim is to show that the thought experiment contains a serious flaw. First it is shown that the implicit assumption that the numbers are nominal is false. This disqualifies Lord's argument as a valid counterexample to Stevens' dictum. Second, it is argued that the football numbers do not represent just the nominal property of non-identity of the players; they also represent the amount of bias in the machine. It is a question about this property\textendash not a property that relates to the identity of the football players\textendash that the statistical test is concerned with. Therefore, only this property is relevant to Lord's argument. We argue that the level of bias in the machine, indicated by the population mean, conforms to a bisymmetric structure, which means that it lies on an interval scale. In this light, Lord's thought experiment\textendash interpreted by many as a problematic counterexample to Stevens' theory of admissible statistics\textendash conforms perfectly to Stevens' dictum.},

Previous research suggests that both emotions are related to the process of counterfactual thinking. The present research extends this idea by combining it with ideas from regret and disappointment theory. The results show that regret is related to behavior-focused counterfactual thought in which the decision-maker's own actions are changed, whereas disappointment is related to situation-focused counterfactual thought in which aspects of the situation are changed. In Study 1 participants (N= 130) were asked to recall an autobiographical episode of either a regretful or a disappointing event. When asked to undo this event, regret participants predominantly changed their own actions, whereas disappointment participants predominantly changed aspects of the situation. In Study 2 all participants (N= 50) read a scenario in which a person experiences a negative event. Participants who were instructed to undo the event by changing the person's actions reported more regret than disappointment, while participants who were instructed to undo the event by changing aspects of the situation reported more disappointment than regret. Study 3 (N= 140) replicated the findings from Study 2 with a different scenario, and a design in which regret and disappointment were measured between rather than within subjects. In the discussion we address the relation among counterfactual thinking, attributions and affective reactions to decision outcomes, and the implications for decision research.},

First, regret is defined as a negative, cognitively based emotion that we experience when realizing or imagining that our present situation would have been better had we acted differently. Next, it is discussed whether this experience can be considered rational and it is argued that rationality only applies to what we do with our regrets, not to the experience itself. Then, research is reviewed showing that both the anticipation of future regret and the experience of retrospective regret influence behavior. The influence of anticipated regret can be considered rational as long as the decision maker can accurately predict the regret that may result from the decision. The influence of experienced regret cannot be considered rational, since decisions should be based on future outcomes, not historical ones. However, influence of experienced regret can be called functional since it may result in increased learning from our mistakes.},

Parallel to what is confirmed for mathematics anxiety, two factors were observed to underly statistics anxiety scores, namely, statistics test anxiety and content anxiety. The study revealed modest though significant correlations between student attributes and the two confirmed dimensions of statistics anxiety. Furthermore, parallel to the inverse correlation reported for mathematics anxiety and maths course performance, statistics anxiety correlated negatively with high school matriculation scores in maths as well as self perceptions of maths abilities. These data lend support to the hypothesis that aversive prior experiences with mathematics, prior poor achievement in maths, and a low sense of maths self-efficacy are meaningful antecedent correlates of statistics anxiety and thus lend some credence to the ``deficit'' interpretation of statistics anxiety.},

Inferences based on usual t- and F-statistics are shown valid for a range of error distributional assumptions including the multivariate-t assumption. Inferences about the scale parameter of the multivariate-t distribution can be made using an F-distribution rather than the usual {$\chi$}\textsuperscript{2} (or inverted {$\chi$}\textsuperscript{2}) distribution.},

In this study, high-resolution paleo-climatic data have been used to explore at a macroscale the effects of climate change on the outbreak of war and population decline in the preindustrial era. We show that long-term fluctuations of war frequency and population changes followed the cycles of temperature change. Further analyses show that cooling impeded agricultural production, which brought about a series of serious social problems, including price inflation, then successively war outbreak, famine, and population decline successively. The findings suggest that worldwide and synchronistic war\textendash peace, population, and price cycles in recent centuries have been driven mainly by long-term climate change. The findings also imply that social mechanisms that might mitigate the impact of climate change were not significantly effective during the study period. Climate change may thus have played a more important role and imposed a wider ranging effect on human civilization than has so far been suggested. Findings of this research may lend an additional dimension to the classic concepts of Malthusianism and Darwinism.},

However, some political issues, such as climate change, have become polarized along party lines, with partisans seemingly impervious to disconfirming information. On these highly polarized issues, can framing sway partisans to moderate their positions, or are partisans so motivated in their issue stances that framing fails? Using a variety of vignettes, and Republican climate change skepticism as a case, this article reports an experiment of how partisans respond to counter-attitudinal framing on a sharply polarized issue. Results indicate that Republicans are resistant to frames that encourage support of governmental action or personal engagement against climate change. There is strong evidence of motivated skepticism, given widespread backfire (or `boomerang') effects and decreased attitudinal ambivalence following exposure to framing, suggesting that issue polarization may severely constrain attempts at communication.},

The present study extends the findings of previous studies and provides further reasons for discontinuing the use of preliminary tests. The study found Type I error rates of a two-stage procedure, consisting of a preliminary Levene test on samples of different sizes with unequal variances, followed by either a Student pooled-variances t test or a Welch separate-variances t test. Simulations disclosed that the twostage procedure fails to protect the significance level and usually makes the situation worse. Earlier studies have shown that preliminary tests often adversely affect the size of the test, and also that the Welch test is superior to the t test when variances are unequal. The present simulations reveal that changes in Type I error rates are greater when sample sizes are smaller, when the difference in variances is slight rather than extreme, and when the significance level is more stringent. Furthermore, the validity of the Welch test deteriorates if it is used only on those occasions where a preliminary test indicates it is needed. Optimum protection is assured by using a separate-variances test unconditionally whenever sample sizes are unequal.},

Two parallel measures were generated for each of two variables with predetermined distribution shapes, correlations between true scores, and population reliability coefficients. The resulting data consisted of error scores, observed scores, sample reliability coefficients, and sample validity coefficients. The correction for attenuation was performed, and means, variances, and relative frequency distributions of both the uncorrected and corrected validity coefficients were analyzed for normal and non-normal distributions. For varying sample sizes and for all population distributions, the means of the corrected sample correlations were very close to the correlation between true scores, provided that the population reliability coefficients were fairly high. The variability of the corrected sample correlations was substantial, even for larger sample sizes. For lower reliability values, there was pronounced overcorrection, combined with extreme variability, especially for smaller sample sizes. Under these conditions, corrections exceeding 1.00 were frequent. The correction for attenuation appears to be useful only if the reliability coefficients of both measures are relatively high and sample size is relatively large. The properties of the correction for attenuation appear to be independent of the shape of the population distribution of test scores, at least for distributions commonly encountered in psychological and educational research.},

  abstract = {In the theory of test validity it is assumed that error scores on two distinct tests, a predictor and a criterion, are uncorrelated. The expected-value concept of true score in the calssical test-theory model as formulated by Lord and Novick, Guttman, and others, implies mathematically, without further assumptions, that true scores and error scores are uncorrelated. This concept does not imply, however, that error scores on two arbitrary tests are uncorrelated, and an additional axiom of ``experimental independence'' is needed in order to obtain familiar results in the theory of test validity. The formulas derived in the present paper do not depend on this assumption and can be applied to all test scores. These more general formulas reveal some unexpected and anomalous properties of test validty and have implications for the interpretation of validity coefficients in practice. Under some conditions there is no attenuation produced by error of measurement, and the correlation between observed scores sometimes can exceed the correlation between true scores, so that the usual correction for attenuation may be inappropriate and misleading. Observed scores on two tests can be positively correlated even when true scores are negatively correlated, and the validity coefficient can exceed the index of reliability. In some cases of practical interest, the validity coefficient will decrease with increase in test length. These anomalies sometimes occur even when the correlation between error scores is quite small, and their magnitude is inversely related to test reliability. The elimination of correlated errors in practice will not enhance a test's predictive value, but will restore the properties of the validity coefficient that are familiar in the classical theory.},

The prior predictive p-value is based on the prior predictive distribution. If we use the original study to compose the prior distribution, then the prior predictive distribution contains datasets that are expected given the original results. To determine whether the new data resulting from a replication study deviate from the data in the prior predictive distribution, we need to calculate a test statistic for each dataset. We propose to use F-bar, which measures to what degree the results of a dataset deviate from an inequality constrained hypothesis capturing the relevant features of the original study: H\_RF. The inequality constraints in H\_RF are based on the findings of the original study and can concern, for example, the ordering of means and interaction effects. The prior predictive p-value consequently tests to what degree the new data deviates from predicted data given the original results, considering the findings of the original study. We explain the calculation of the prior predictive p-value step by step, elaborate on the topic of power, and illustrate the method with examples. The replication test and its integrated power and sample size calculator are made available in an R-package and an online interactive application. As such, the current study supports researchers that want to adhere to the call for replication studies in the field of psychology.},

  abstract = {In order to investigate the relation between dispositional coping style and actual coping behaviour under threat, 53 undergraduate psychology students anticipated a mild stressor (bloody slides) in Part I of the experiment. Observable behaviour turned out to be unrelated to dispositional monitoring and blunting as measured by the Miller Behavioral Style Scale (MBSS; Miller, 1987) and the Threatening Medical Situations Inventory (TMSI; van Zuuren and Hanewald, 1993). However, when cognitions were also taken into account, some significant correlations emerged with the MBSS as well as with the TMSI. In Part II (N = 40), intrusive thinking after exposure to the experimental stressor was related to dispositional coping style. High monitors, as compared with low monitors (moderate monitors excluded) were found to elaborate the stressful experience in a more diffuse and extended way.},

  abstract = {Abstract Many philosophers of science and methodologists have argued that the ability to repeat studies and obtain similar results is an essential component of science. A finding is elevated from single observation to scientific evidence when the procedures that were used to obtain it can be reproduced and the finding itself can be replicated. Recent replication attempts show that some high profile results---most notably in psychology, but in many other disciplines as well---cannot be replicated consistently. These replication attempts have generated a considerable amount of controversy and the issue of whether direct replications have value has, in particular, proven to be contentious. However, much of this discussion has occurred in published commentaries and social media outlets, resulting in a fragmented discourse. To address the need for an integrative summary, we review various types of replication studies and then discuss the most commonly voiced concerns about direct replication. We provide detailed responses to these concerns and consider different statistical ways to evaluate replications. We conclude there are no theoretical or statistical obstacles to making direct replication a routine aspect of psychological science.},
