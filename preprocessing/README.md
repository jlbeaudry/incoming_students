# Preprocessing

This folder contains the preprocessing script.

The preprocessing script reads data files from the raw data folder within the survey folder
[./survey/data] (./survey/data) but does not write anything to that folder. This generates
the clean data files [./data/students_processed.csv] (./data/students_processed.csv).
