# Data

The "students_processed.csv" data file is generated automatically, using 
the script in the [preprocessing] folder. They should not be edited by hand, 
nor should any of the analysis files alter these data files.

The "crisis_descriptions.csv" data file is also generated automatically, using 
the script in the [preprocessing] folder. The "crisis_descriptions_marked.csv" is 
a coded version of the descriptions file where participants' descriptions of 
the replication crisis are coded as accurate or inaccurate. 

The "students_metadata.csv" file is used in the preprocessing and Rmd scripts to 
relabel some of the variables. It also explains each of the variables used in the 
survey and data set.
