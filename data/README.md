# Data

The "students_processed.csv" data file is generated automatically, using 
the script in the [preprocessing] folder. They should not be edited by hand, 
nor should any of the analysis files alter these data files.

The "crisis_descriptions.csv" data file is also generated automatically, using 
the script in the [preprocessing] folder. 

Two independent coders marked participants' descriptions of the replication crisis
as accurate or inaccurate in the "crisis_descriptions_marked_1.csv" and 
"crisis_descriptions_marked_2.csv" files, respectively. The comparison between the two
coders is included in the "crisis_descriptions_marked_comparison.csv". The disagreements
were resolved through discussion between the two coders. The "crisis_descriptions_marked.csv" 
is the double-coded version of the descriptions file, which is used in the .Rmd. 

The "students_metadata.csv" file is used in the preprocessing and .Rmd scripts to 
relabel some of the variables. It also explains each of the variables used in the 
survey and data set.
